Sentimental Analysis of Product based reviews 


Sentiment Analysis also known as Opinion Mining refers to the use of natural language processing, text analysis to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine

In this project, we aim to perform Sentiment Analysis of product based reviews. Data used in this project are online product reviews collected from "amazon.com". We expect to do review-level categorization of review data with promising outcomes.
