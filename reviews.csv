Don't buy this phone,1,  Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
One of the good choice for low budget phone,4,  If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
Bad camera and made in China,1,  Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
Simply excellent. Read complete review written after my 30 days of experience,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."

Value-For-Money & Recommended for a normal user,4,"  I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
Poor,1,  Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
Dont buy it as lower model is good then this,3,"  Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
BUDGET WORTHY PHONE,5,  Nice phone.. overall performance is just amazing
Poor processor basic UI also lagging,3,"  COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"

Redme 9A,3,  No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
Best under budget phone,5,  Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
Smooth and satisfying,5,"  Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
Good but not up to the mark,3,  Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
Awesome loved it,5,  It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
Excellent phone,5,"  Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
Stopüî¥üî¥üî¥,2,  Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
Cons and Pros,3,"  This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ‚ô•Ô∏è no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
Goooooooood,3,  Weary good product  very fast delivery
Points to be noted,3,"  Points to be noted:üëâ The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.üëâ This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.üëâ Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.üëâ Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.üëâ After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
Made in china,2,  Phone is good. But it is made in China
Best phone for PARENTS. 5/5 for Rs.6800,5,"  Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
Best in this price range,5,  Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
Wow,5,  Wow
Very worst,1,"  I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
Good,4,"  Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
Screen resolution is not good & worst camera ever.. rest so so..,2,  Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
Value for money or not?,4,"  So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5‚≠ê for thatPros-‚Ä¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this range‚Ä¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.‚Ä¢Good for basic usage.‚Ä¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:‚Ä¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)‚Ä¢Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"

"Waste of money, Worst customer service.",1,"  I am never going to buy any electronic product from amazon anymore. Experienced worst customer service. Product is not upto the mark. Over heating, network connectivity issue was there. They were using their aaps to dignose in which everything will be showing normal. The same aap can not be used in any other phones for checking. That means this aap is specifically designed by amazone for amazon bought mobiles. You will never know if this is correct or not. Based upon that refund/ replancement will not be done. Amozon update your customer service otherwise if customers make you customers can also break you. After 2 days of continuos chasing no result. Wasted Rs 7498/-."

Not recommended and a cheating,1,"  Amazon is now becomes a cheater, there is no way to return the item..it has below shortcomings..Poor Camera quality, though it has feature for Portrait and Landscape but in landscape mode the clicked pictures are blurred...Poor battery performance, the 5000mAh battery is so poor that it significantly heats up entire phone within  2-5 minutes and drains the battery. Weight is also quite more.I tried to return the item, it says have a test with some software or talk to technical team (after uploading no. of things, very tedious), there are many sites in which you can have hassle free return...You will get frustrated and defiantly could not be able to return the item..there is no way to interact on email and call..so select the items very very carefully..otherwise they are sitting there to cheat your hard earned money...be careful.."

Is anyone else having this issue? Asked for replacement. Let's see what amazon do with this issue!Update: After my complaint, Amazon replaced my phone with a brand new piece. But the same issue happened with it also. So again I complained and I am so thankful to Amazon that they took my phone back and told me that they will refund my money. Phone was taken back, just waiting for my refund now.If you have a Jio sim, just go for it. It is an awesome phone but If you are Airtel or Vi customer then there will be some issue with VoLte and VoWifi."

We buyers must also do our homework before buying a high-tech product.,1,"  I want to share a live (semi-positive) experience with Amazon a week back. I purchased a Redmi 9A phone for my grandson on 21 Dec. The phone came on 24th, but wouldn't boot. I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't bootü•µAnother round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN üò¢üò¢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day‚ùóMoral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier üôè"
China DESH KA PHONE......,3,"  Why do you advertise this phone as DESH KA SMARTPHONE. Did you know, What is the meaning of DESH?. I thought of buying a phone by made in India. But Amazon delivered to me a phone by made in China. Not just the phone, the charger and charging cable are made in China!. If we buy a smartphone at a discount, will you behave substandard manner?"

Video Audio quality.,4,"  Phone is good and battery backup is very nice,working long time. But one thing i faced that i bought on first sale i found one problem that video recording audio not good very low hearing then i returned that one and get change  with new. After getting new one i found that problem is same and that not problem its phone problem. Phone video recording audio is very low compare to others phone. I can't hear clear voice in even low distance recording."
Best for Average usage.,5,"  Overall mobile is good for an average usage. Its camera, audio quality is average to good. Its performance is very good because of good internal storage.Handy as well as the screen is quite wide and provides good viewing angle.Plus point is its battery which is quite huge. Has microusb slot and charger is of 10W thats why charging might be somewhat slow (not that fast)If you want the mobile for an average usage then this can be a best deal for you.I got this 2gb Ram 32gb Rom varient in 6800 Rs.Or if your usage is high i would recommend to go for some other Redmi products for price beyond 8000 to 9000.Below 7000 this product gives satisfactory performance."
Leaves a sour taste,1,"  Pros:1. Performance is Ok, for the price.2. 2 SIM + 1 Micro SD Card Slot, i.e. no hybrid slotsCons:1. Too many advertisements and installs 3rd party apps forcefully. This is not mentioned in the listing. This should be made mandatory. But thankfully practically almost everything can be uninstalled.2. Micro USB port for charging is unacceptable in 20213. Used a MIUI based phone long time ago, somehow I feel it has become much worse and confusing. Even changing your notification sound or ringtone takes some effort and a little bit of scratching your head. They should include a manual LOL."
Very Nice budget phone.,5,"  Ordered Redmi 9A 3GB 32GB version, sky blue for my mother 2 days ago. Delivery was quick. The delivery guy also opened the package on request for assurance. Got the product as ordered.Initial impressions:Pros:Large screen, Nice color, good processor, ample RAM for daily normal user, good battery backup, drains very gradually even if you are on calls whole day. Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions. (Very good in daylight or external use.)One of the best phones available in the market at this price. I have given it 5 star for specifications in this price range. I ordered it with an offer.. More than what you can get from any other Indian brand in 7000 rs."
"Very Fast, Superb Video Calling Clarity",5,"  I was using iPhone 6s Plus and when I got this phone for Rs. 7,500, I was surprised ! It have more display clarity and camera clarity than my iPhone. Also it is as fast as my iPhone. Mi have combined All features of ios and Android in this Phone, that make this phone special compared to other Android Phones. Its OS is Mi modified version of Android. The modified version is very intelligent and smart. It have removed all the disadvantages of Android Phones. It have iPhone features like Face unlock, time lapse video, burst mode and exposure increase and decrese in camera etc.Sound clarity also superb.My Brother in the US have amazed to see the better clarity of video calling than my previos iPhone."

Basic android smartphone,5,"  A basic android smartphone for basic android experience. If you're looking for an entry level smartphone with android os then this is a phone for you. This model packs a 3gb ram and 32gb internal storage which is more than sufficient for your daily needs from Facebook to YouTube and anything in between.

"Most pathetic product - BE warned - DO NOT BUY !!! Battery, Memory and Bandwidth hogging phone.",1,"  This is the most pathetic product that I have ever had the misfortune to buy on Amazon - and you cannot return the product and hope to exchange it for something else because they do not permit ""RETURNS"" only ""REPLACEMENT""  - WITH THE SAME GODFORESAKEN PHONE!!!!!""It comes preloaded with MIUI and other inefficient memory, bandwidth  and battery draining bloatware and constant advertisements all over the place  - and there is no way you can disable them - by buying this phone you are compromising your data and security and paying for an advertiser to constantly bombard you with adverts for thoroughly useless products -  and you have to pay for the bandwidth he uses up.In an attempt to get rid of MIUI you cannot even flash a custom ROM like LineageOS or some of the other AltROMs cause the manufacturers of the device will not share the code. SO IF YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS DEVICE YOU ARE STUCK.Do not buy - if you happen to have paid for it then your fate is sealed - you cannot hope for a refund ---- better to spend that money on buying some cow dung - might help make a cow happy!"
Nice Phone for doing normal works,3,"  This phone is helpful in basic things, camera quality is not good at all, specially rear camera is not good it is really a 8mp camera but Redmi is saying it 12 or 13 MP...making fool to customers. Overall it is good for taking online classes, making calls, using whatsapp but not for gaming, you can play normal games but if you play games like free fire, it starts heating and lagging. Battery is actually 4800 mAh.."
"Durable phone, worth every single rupee!",5,"  I ordered the phone during amazon 1-month deepawali sale, when it was selling for Rs 6,800. I exchanged my old Redmi phone and got further Rs 3,600 off. Plus I made the purchase using HDFC Bank credit card and got 10% cashback. Net net, i got the phone for Rs 3,150.But buying the phone at a cheap price wasn't the highlight. Its performance has not disappointed me.The features have upgraded and the Redmi-9A offers more bang for the buck. Features are intuitive and easy to use. My contact list was restored in no time.The 13MP camera is really good and, in my opinion, as good as an iPhone. I am exploring the phone's features and it has been a pleasant experience for me.If you are looking to upgrade your phone then PLEASE DON'T LOOK FURTHER!Rajagopalan VBengaluru"
Worth for the money,5,  Worth for the money.. I dont see similar features in other brand for this price range. My parents liked it very much... Wish they added some headphones to this. The color really pop's I was little hesitant while ordering about the color. But it's beautiful üòçüòçüòç
DEFECTIVE PRODUCT RECEIVED,1,"  The bad news was that I received a defective piece (what I feared the most because many customers posted review about defect). The good news was that my refund was processed on the same day as I filed the complaint with picture proof as attached here as well and I received the refund amount within 3 days.Plus, there were these black parallel horizontal lines on the screen, which I just couldn't understand why it was there. The phone looked pretty good (colour and built wise). Maybe would have been a nice one if I hadn't received a defective product."
JUST GO FOR IT.. ü§©,5,"  Amazing phone in such a low price.Great don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick face recognition, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have dual Or tripple cameras because its single camera beats most of the dual and triple camera phones, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick and last thing don't think like its cheap so obviously it will have poor looks and downgraded, no in this phone this isn't the case. Overall I'll give full stars and attaching some samples which have been slightly edited with In built editor.."
Excellent Price!,4,"  I bought this phone in the sale for a ridiculously low price. Firstly if you are someone who uses a lot of apps then this phone is not for you. It is a basic android phone which can be used for photos, WhatsApp and a few others. For the price, one shouldn't expect more. If you load a lot of apps expect the phone to go slow.The build quality was surprisingly excellent and the call quality was also good. Watching videos was also good.Frankly, for this price, I cannot complain about anything.Excellent buy in my opinion."
A good exchange offer,4,"  Pros. 1. This was bought on exchange offer, and I got a good price for my old phone. The exchange was smooth and there were no issues. Was very happy with the transaction.2. I have had it for just two weeks. So I cannot comment on durability, etc. No problem so far. Everything is as described on the Amazon page.3. The phone looks good and I am happy with the purchase.Cons.  Because it was an exchange transaction, the phone was not delivered as fast as for a full cash transaction. I ordered on 25 January and got the phone on 6 February. But I was kept updated about possible delivery dates, etc. So I was not worried.All in all, well worth it."
Good product,4,  The product is good in this price range and as a xiaomi lover you can buy it
Cheap phone with lots of incorrect details,2,  The camera provided in the phone is not  13mp at all.Picture quality is not good and it does not reflect the true colors.its ok that it is a cheap phone but atleast they should mention the correct configuration. If you compare camera picture quality with nokia phones I must say that 2mp camera in nokia made phones have better picture quality that 13mp of this phone. Its OK that this is vewry cheap phone but customer should not think that they will get a 13mp camera. Samsung or nokia make phones with 8mp camera might have better picture quality.rest i can write once i use this phone for a month.
Good and affordable,5,  Very cool phone at this price and camera is average but overall I would recommend choose Redmond over realme
An attractive deal and a reliable phone,4,"  I bought this phone on the amazon prime sale. It was a great deal will a of discounts and I was able to buy it for under ‚Çπ9,000. I've been using this phone for almost a month now and here are my feedbacks.Firstly the good points. Very sleek, good screen size and the menus are user friendly. It has face unlock, pattern and pin unlock as well but no biometric. I can't be asking for more features for this price. 2 sim trays and one SD card tray which is great. I had been using both sim trays form this phone.Now for the bad points. I'm not able to set 2 different ring tones for each sim. So when a call comes in you can only tell by looking at the screen showing on which sim I am getting the call. Next, Screen brightness is not that great. On a bright sunny day, its sometimes not bright enough even if you turn brightness to the highest. Hotspot works fine but you cannot see how many devices are connected. Moreover, you also cannot see which device is connected. Then there are those unwanted, useless Mi apps that comes standard in the phones that send you notifications to upgrade and install even though those apps have not been updated by me.These are the major points. Apart from this, there seems to be no other issues. For a secondary phone this phone is great. Value for money."
Upgraded version of Basic Mobile,2,"  In the name of ""Budget"" phones, quality and features of the mobile is compromised. The camera quality is very poor. Adding to it, the mobile is full of bloatware which reduces the speed of the mobile. Most irritating is ads everywhere - In music, App explorer, Homescreen, in lock mode, wallpaper. You name it and there is an add"
Good quality under budget,4,"  Good product for budget price rangeBut camera quality is average otherwise, value for money  product"
Good,5,"  Happy to buy this good mobile , but little bit specs missing but value for money"
Worst experience,1,  Worst mobile within 10 days we got sound problem. Whatever I am playing no sound at all. After 10 days no return policy.
Dublicate product,1,  One of the Cheapest Chinese product in this category again. It is mentioned as 5000 mah battery in the specification but actually it is not upto the mark. Actually I bought this phone for my father as it has a bigger battery. But it drains automatically within 2 days when there is no usage. But redmi 8A which I am using presently is much better product when compared to this product.I don't know whether XIOMI is prescribing wrong speciation or AMAZON is selling a dublicate product. But my suggestion is don't buy this product even when you have little usage.
9a,5,  ùêçùê¢ùêúùêû
Decent product for its price!,4,"  Best choice for low budget.BATTERY:It is upto use. If you use light apps and its normal function battery last upto 5-6 hours approx.#Using heavy apps(games) definately hange the device and heat it up.CAMERA:Looking at its price camera is decent . Quality is not too good, but can capture your precious moments at a decent quality.WEIGHT:Weight is light easy to handle .Looks nice.VIDEO QUALITY:The experience is not that hd  but gives you a nice experience. Sound quality is also good.It doesn't have fingerprint sensor , there is no back cover."
For the price it is ok..,3,  A good phone for the price.Seems little bit lagging. Back camera good but front camera pathetic. Not good for elderly people because bit bulky.Display is ok. Some of the apps like Google nearby sharing and files go app file sharing is not working.For the price range it is ok..Auto display brightness is crappy..
Overall good phone for daily use but go for 3gb variant.,4,"  Phone is good those who want a decent phone for daily use but first of all turn off all annoying ads they provide. No doubt on built quality, it is solid, durable. Battery life is very good. Camera gets the job done for daily use. I have 2gb variant which I won't recommend for others because I can feel slight lag if 4 apps are in the background, Go for Poco C3 3gb variant as it is the same brand of Mi,also it has better processer n u get 500rs discount on HDFC debit card. I trust Mi for long term use, I never had bad experience. Thumbs up if you find this helpful."
Good in use,4,  Smart use
"Camera poor quality,Hang",1,"  Worst packaging,Camera poor quality,mobile hanging while opening apps in it.Product is little bit ok."
Purchased the 3GB/32GB Nature Green Redmi 9A at Rs. 7499,4,  Purchased the Nature Green colour case on 23 Feb 2021 and was delivered on 25 Feb 2021. I've used it for a good couple of weeks and reviewing this purchase on 09 March 2021.It's value for money. The Camera quality is good and battery life is long as well.Actually I've placed another order for the Sea Blue colour one today.I also purchased mobile case and tempered glass with this purchase. below are the detailsBracevor Hybrid Back Cover Kickstand Case for Xiaomi Mi Redmi 9A and JGD PRODUCTS¬Æ Tempered Glass for Redmi 9A-Edge to Edge Full Screen Coverage.
Pathetic Phone,1,"  Product is below average. This is third Mi phone that I bought and all the three have had network (card) problems. Camera clarity is good but takes 10 sec to launch.. again, poor experience. Battery is good, but compared to other phones in this range, it take double the time to charge... hence the fast charging option too is not at par.Overall A very poor experience with Mi phones. I'll never buy Mi phone in future and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE."
Don't Buy This!!!,3,"  I ordered this phone day after today and it has been delivered to me. I did not like this phone at all because this phone heats up quickly and the sound of the phone speaker is also very low. Therefore, I would suggest that you spend more than 2000 rupees. And buy other smartphones of Realme.But in this MRP it is good"
Fantastic Smartphone .....,5,  Good Smartphone in low budget lover for normal use.I gifted to my wife and she is very happy with phone and it's colors.I received within 4 days.Redmi needs to price 7000 with fingerprint function.Thanks
Good inexpensive phone,3,"  It comes with 2GB of RAM. The Redmi 9A runs Android 10 and is powered by a 5000mAh non-removable battery. The Redmi 9A supports proprietary fast charging. As far as the cameras are concerned, the Redmi 9A on the rear packs a 13-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture.Redmi 9A is not the best choice when choosing an inexpensive smartphone. It got a lot of flaws. On the positive side of Redmi 9A, there are high-quality assembly and materials of use. Also, the screen size is larger, decent battery life"
Good and worth it.,4,"  Got delivered on time. Best budget level phone. Has good outer body design with attractive colour.Specs are good and user interface is smooth and lag free.Cameras are okay, not great. Yes it has a AI mode for better usage.Gets warm while using but no heating issue. Came with 55% battery charge.Overall a good buy in this price range."
Overall good product,3,  Battery quality superb at this rate .long lasting.camera quality is not good as I thought.average camera.display is perfect. Not useable for gamers.aged people can use.overall good phone.kindly press the helpful button
Good mobile at 7k range,4,"  I bought this mobile to use it for calling purpose ,just needed an extra mobile for me. It comes with 3 gb ram and 32 gb hd., Which is suffice to me. Its a good phone for basic necessities like calling, browsing and apps, not a good camera, no fingerprint reader, battery life is good, charging is fast. It's a value for money if you looking at a mobile with 7k range with big screen size and 3 gb ram."
Don't Purchase this product...,1,  Issue started within 10 days of purchase of this product. My phone doesn't charge inspite keeping in charging for 2 hours.Amazon gave us 07 days replacement but the issue started on 10th day. Spoken to the team denied replacement of the product told us to go redmi service gallery for any issue. Now have to keep all my work aside and have to run behind the gallery people to get my phone repaired..Highly disappointed with the services from Amazon ..Worst Worst Product Don't buy people...

"Horrible phone, slow and freezes very often. My previous phone redmi 7A was much better",1,"  Horrible phone, slow and freezes very often. My previous phone redmi 7A was much better.Pros:Superb battery lifeBig screen (useful for browsing)Sturdy phone, has fallen a few times, nothing brokeConsDisplay resolution is badCamera is patheticHangs very often , when switching between apps"
Beaware!!!,5,"  In description, mention that the mobile is manufacturing by Rising Stars Mobile india pvt. Ltd., that is India, But see the picture, there mention Made in China.As per my coversation with Amazon as follows:1. Firstly they say...the batch or the lot which you have received possibly it's a old one.Me: how is this possible, after lunch, i purchase this phone on 2nd sale. How it could be old one.2. Amazon: From now onward the same product we are providing to our customers it's ""manufacturing in India"" this information is mentioned on the box itself.Me: what is this means, from now onward...Means previously manufactured in china or actual manufactured in china, there after comes to india and just replace the sticker.How is possible, a product made in India and print on that item other country name.I think they make people to fool and make money, just writing MADE IN INDIA.I request to you also, those are purchased this item please check the truth.And lastly this is possible on mobile/ any other products, those we cheated by amazon."
GOOD BUDGET PHONE,4,"  Redmi 9A is one of the most affordable smartphone by Redmi. It is available in two variants of 2GB + 32GB model priced at Rs. 6,799, while the 3GB + 32GB variant carries a price tag of Rs. 7,499.I Purchased on 23rd Sep.20.l expect it will be good. It is in great  demand. I think it's a good budget  Phone."
Very bad,1,  I hope these reviw help those who want to buy it is not good pohne at all as it hangups a lot for daily usade event the pohne also does not ha a type c which is downgraded. If you want to take these pohne it is bad opt even the delivery services also sucks and very bad service from amazon even i dont want to give single star also
Front camera is very disappointing during nightlights.,3,"  Overall it is a very budget phone.In 6799 it is offering 6.5 inch screen. Screen is good and HD. I don't expect much from this phone as I have gifted it to my wife,so no need of high end multitasking and speed performance but its front camera is very disappointing during night. It shows very blurry pictures in night. The dot dots are very much visible while taking pictures at night, just like a classic phone cameras of 2005 2010. I have used many MI phones ,the cameras was upto the mark,but this time its very disappointing.I was so disappointed with the camera that I ordered replacement but I cancelled it soon for not taking the headache of setting up the phone again. I think it wasn't the single piece defect. There's a degraded quality front camera in redmi 9A. In daytime there's no issue but it is not meant for pictures in nightlights."
Worst,1,  This is hanging a lot and they don't return it ..... Just replace the product worst phone don't go for it
Too Good to Handle in Daily life,5,  thanks Amazon for so good product at best price in the marketphone is very big size screen and 3 GB RAM is totally smooth function to operatecamera is too good and quality is goodall the functions are working properly and the best thing is that it has very nice grip in the back side
Hanging,1,"  Believe the review its hang much.Even in the calling tab when you touch on the search people it takes time.2gb ram what a joke its not even working like 1gb.My old redmi note 3 (2017) works greater than thisThis is so irritating.If you have budget issue, I will suggest you to buy other brand. if you want to buy only redmi then I will suggest you to don't buy any redmi phone that's falls under 10000."
Not much expected,3,  Camera quality is not much expected. Battery backup and screen size is good
Nice Phone in 2300 because i got it in a exchange of my old realme c2,3,"  Nice Phone in 2300 for me in exchange my realme c2Pros to be considered :-Camera -3.5* , nice picture in 13mp don't compare to 48 or 64 at this price i think it's better than my previous phone the photos look naturalDisplay - 4*  ,6.5 inch 720p big and nice display but could have been little brighterProcessor - 3*. The g25 is decent for daily useag but, They could have provided g35 atleast but in day to day nice performance , normal game running without any problem.Battery - 3.5* , battery life is nice can run whole day with normal and some gaming no problem but one issue they said it was 5000mah battery but if you check in any Phone information app on Google Play they show only 4100mah battery so you can check yourselfCons  to be considered:-Now there is no gyroscope or electronic compass in sensors , no or blaster ,no type c , no fingerprint sensor.In 7k i would not recommend this phone redmi 7a is much better deal or realme c3 , but since i got it in a exchange of only 2300 rupees i think it's bang for buck deal for me, but GST are increased to 18% so if you buy any 10000 phone you will pay 1800 or 2k to tex in government so smartphone prices are increased dramatically , that's why they are no longer value for money phone in smartphone market right now.Amazon service is really incredible for exchange, i try to exchange my phone through flipkart but they denied for no reason they have fraud exchange policy. But i have very nice experience with Amazon service , the delivery boy was good too ,Thanks for fantastic service Amazon.Thanks for your time and reading this long review.I will update later"
Super phone...,5,"  Phone looking is very niceBattery back up is very niceIn this price range ,this mobile is goodBut camara is not that much good but okNot coming any case along with mobile,they should have provided case.Over all mobile is very nice..."
Good,5,  Amazing product with this price
Go for it!,5,  The phone is good to give an elder person who does not need a very powerful phone. It's also gotta  large  screen that apt for reading. I say go for it as a budget phone. Gifted it to my mother... She is not the least bit tech savvy. I have not tried any heavy gaming on it so cannot say.The daylight photos are stunning and clear. Have not checked not time pictures.The charger get the phone charged pretty quick.Using it for fifteen days.Go for it!
A downgrade over Redmi 8A. Not worth it.,3,"  When you consider its predecessor the 8A/8A Dual, this one is a major downgrade. A sluggish Helio chipset, Type B charging port, an unnecessarily tall screen, bad camera all combine to deliver a not so VFM product. I am saying this coz I have the 8A Dual as well... Not impressed. With every series, there are too many compromises which is very much unlike Redmi"
Great value for money with low budget,4,  It doesn't comes with fingerprint sensor althought phone has massive battery with decent processors.charging around 2.5 hrs to complete from 0 to 95%. I didn't face any bugs right now. Made of this phone is excellent build quality and big screen added much advantage  it comes with 10w mi charger not supports fast charging.
Value for your money,3,  Value for money....Mediatec processor is bit slower.. dont expect a good cam..Frond cam was good  ...A good phone for older people who did not use much apps...6800 INR
Not so good,3,"  Camera quality is not as per the expectations, with 13 mp you get better camera quality but this phone has bad camera quality pics along with phone volume very less. Average phone i would say for regular use but doesn't justify it's specifications."
Radmi 9A,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
It sucks,1,"  Within 4 months of buying this phone, the storage was full. I didn't get even half of the 32 gb this phone bragged about. And that's all because of the useless pre-installed apps this phone comes with that no one, NO ONE, needs. I can't get rid of those stupid Xiaomi apps. This sucks. Never buying from Xiaomi again."
Good for below average users.,3,  The performance is not as good as specified in the discription. Camera parameters are good but the picture is not as good as it should be with these specifications. Overall it is good for below average users. But don't think of playing games on it as it hangs even on playing simple games like subway surfers. Battery is good and lasts about a day.
JUST A SIMPLE PRODUCT. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH,4,  To be frank it is a good product for the priceYou can't expect too much from it‚Ä¢The camera is ok type but not much features in editing the photos‚Ä¢There too many in built apps but they can be removed if not required‚Ä¢The screen is not bright at all its really dull to see‚Ä¢good delivery by amazon‚Ä¢Only good thing is that you get 3gb with 32 GB storage and a really big screen‚Ä¢It is good for people who don't expect much from their mobiles and use phones for a basic necessity‚Ä¢If you are looking for more features then I do not recommend this you have other options in this price‚Ä¢You also need to buy a cover and screen protector‚Ä¢The box only has the phone with charger and the manual with invoice of bill
Better to not to purchase MI products,1,  I am writing this review after 6 months....After 6 months phone was automatically restart & some time it will go to off mode it may takes 1 or 2 day's to  come back to on mode.... Service center guys saying bord issue but this boar was not available now....

Great Phone at this Budget and Ultra Fast Delivery.,5,"  I really Love Redmi Phones. My First Phone was Redmi 8A. I bought this phone as a Gift for my Dad.Great offers by Amazon for this Phone. You cant Buy a Super Smartphone Like this at a Price Range of 7500 Rs - 3GB  RAM Variant anywhere in the Online World or at Retail Stores. I love the Fact that Redmi 9A is Far Lighter than Redmi 8a. I ordered the Phone on 2nd November and i Got it on 3rd November. It was not even a Complete day, as there was 2 hrs left for a day to complete. Fastest Delivery by Amazon even for a Standard Delivery Order. I would love to continue my Shopping with Amazon.You can Go for this Phone Blindly.Such a Feasible phone. Love it."

Nice Buy for parents,5,  I bought 2 GB Ram mobile for my parents. Its working well and surprisingly it looks slim and weight also less compare to other 5000mps battery mobiles. Big display is the game changer here. User friendly OS.For elders they dont need finger scanner . Finally satisficed with the all round impression under the price of 6200/-Average camera can not expect more at this price range at this moment.
Overall a good product in budget.,4,  I liked its processing speed which is very good. The ram is genuinely faster. Camera quality is average. Battery backup in this range is also good. The only problem with this model is that it does lack a good internet speed. I mean whatever sim card you are using this device will not give that much internet speed than what you expect. Sometimes the experience is horrible. The internet speed is very slow in this device whether you use any 4g sim. But what do you expect in this budget. It is a budgeted phone with some limitations.
Budget Friendly,3,"  Purchased this for my Mom. I don't say that this is an awesome mobile but I can tell you that at this price range it's okay to gift this to people for normal usage. Although the camera quality wasn't good at all, I was happy with the ram and storage provided at this price range.Camera Quality: 1/5Processor: 3/5Battery Life: 5/5Worth the money: 4/5"
Not at all happy with the product üòï,1,  I have ordered this Redmi 9A mobile phone as it is reasonable and compatible with my daily use as per the reviews which i got but unfortunately after owning it i have had very bad experience with the battery as it always heats up to the extreme and seems like it can explode any moment..and that too it was for the first time i have connected the charger and was shocked when it got heated up.I request the product approval team to please take a look into this issue with the product.I hope won‚Äôt be disappointed next time.Thank you!
How phone working,4,  Nice phone
- Phone hangs very frequently - Battery life is not reliable if you travel a lot.,3,  Like:- Features which exist in this price range of 6.5K -7K. Makes the phone affordable to many looking out for budget phone with an aim to use for 3 yrs.Dislike: Honest feedback from an educated & wise user.- Phone hangs very frequently (Even when space is enough nd the phone is new like 1 month)- Battery life expires in 24hrs. if you internet is on & talk continuously (I do due to my work). in 12hrs. if you watch too many online videos or listens music.
Value for money,5,  The product is awesome. Looking drop dead eye‚ù§
Nice product within the given price range!,5,"  Redmi 9A (32 GB) is a good mobile phone for those with limited budget. It has got all the nice features and functions. The screen is big, good fingerprint reader, amazing battery life, and a nice camera quality.The phone functions smoothly overall."
Cheap and best,4,"  It is worthable for this price, we can't play pubg and equal to pubg games. For online class this one much enough for the school and college students, it doesn't come with headphone,Camera quality rear is good and the front is OK for online class not for over exposure,It doesn't have finger print, screen size is bigger.I can suggest the people who is trying to buy this product.Seller send me the courier with safe and goodWe can buy it.Enjoy all!"
Best budget phone.,5,  I bought it for 5199 Rs with exchange (samsung J7) . I'm not much into camera or gaming. I bought it for daily use. Best battery life and good camera. Big screen makes watching movie great. Totally good buy for 5199 Rs.
Go for it if you have a tight budget!,4,"  1) Battery life is great!!üëåNo heating problem is found...2) Back camera is good in this price...3) While video recording with front camera i have found little bit hazy, but while taking selfie it is clear, could not understand why this is happening...4) Time taken for full charging from 20% battery life :- 2 hrs with its 10w charger5) Voice recording is very good & clear! Perfect for singers...6) A fingerprint sensor should be provided!‚òπÔ∏è7) Display is also Nice...8) Otherwise satisfied in this price..."
Decent. But worse camera,3,  Overall mob is good. They say it has 32gb storage available but when u get the mobile due to all internal apps u get only 20gb left. Never felt lag Or hang due to multie use of apps. Os quite ok. But worst thing is camera. It's almost same quality as some keypad mobile. And they have done a frod saying it's 13 mp but only 10 mp!!!!!!!!!! with badquality. And photos do not have shot on redmi. Exept camera overall decent mobile
Nice Phone at this price.,5,"  Redmi 9A is a good phone for normal use. The battery life is really encouraging. Battery lasts for almost two days even if Social medias are used. Sound quality is good, Camera is good at its level.Overall a value for money phone."
"Don't Buy,, Useless Camera,, Awesome UI",2,"  Don't Buy,, below avg Camera, for 13 MP, Its not even 2MP camera, Camera has very Low (live FP), MI WAS GOOD BUT NOW MI IS MAKING MONEY, My old MI 6 prime is better than this it has which cost 6000INR,, GO for RealMe C2,  same 13 MP camera for 7000 INR only, is Awesome... Dont Buy MI EVER they are making money now"
Good,3,  No finger print. Just below average phone. It's good for an average use. But its Worth of 7500. Good for online class. I think no other company gives 3gb ram and 32 gb memory with 5000 mah battery and fine camera quality. With 7500 rs
Wow redmi 3rd quality,1,"  This phone is looking good but working bad,very lowest quality phone.If I want search number with any alphabet in contact takes to much time ,all time slow working.So dont buy this phone .Other wise you will  realise after purchae me like because return window has close ,so I have no option.Waste my money."
Not good.,3,"  Direction sensor(magnetometer sensor)not in this phone.You can't get directionality when using maps(you will be always facing one direction.)Apart from this everything is fine for this budget.Not better than Redmi8A dual.I am satisfied with this phone because this is my secondary phone.But for thu guys who are having this as their first,you have better options if using a vouple of hundreds more."
4Star,4,  Redmi9A is really a best phone under this price but when we talk about its camera its third class and you can't buy this phone for photography purpose. Overall phone is good for normal working.
Excellent üëå,5,  My review after using it for 12 daysBest smartphone in this budgetSmartphone is very fast and smooth workingOnly defect is that the camera quality is average but at this price it's perfect
ordered on diwali sale,5,  when ordering your m-phone online you can't review cam. battery health etc.You might be wasting time.That's already available in bulk on YT.You can get detailed review of all there. Talking about order and exp. i've been ordering now since quite a while approx. mpre than 4-5years now.Delivery agent was quite polite this time.packing was excellent.product was up to the mark.every thing was good.Go for it![ amazon ]
Lovely,5,  Good product
Defective display panel,2,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†The dispaly went flickering from the moment I unpacked the phone and booted it. Disappointed and ordered a replacement. Issue didn't resolve even in multiple reeboots or taking MIUI update after first boot."
Not satisfied,2,  I ordered this phone 1 month ago in the flash sale ...that time I got that phone ..& it was written Made in India...But yesterday I received my 2nd phone.it is written Made in China...why is this? I am really confused...& My space button is not working at the time of contact saving.
Fabulous 1,5,"  Again 1 more redmi 9 series with our family. This time for our mother-in-law. We hope in first sights itself looks like made for her, simple and user friendly phone with all good feature's,,, great to go head,,,"

A great buy for Under 7k.,3,"  ""Battery life"" is great to be honest. i like the display tall, Bright. ""camera quality"" is not match any expectations. Expectations was quite average though for this price point. bloatware always been a hurdle for Mi phones.If You get it under 7K 3gigs ram go for kill.""Game performance"" was good as per the price G25 surprisingly Good processor. Overall a value for money. Ditching Fingerprint not a great option though."
Overall good performance,5,"  The one thing which every Xiaomi mobile is having is its abnormal weight compared to other mobile brand phones of similar features. The camera does not reach up to the expectation but the overall performance of the mobile phone is all ok. It has no fingerprint sensor, thus allows only face and other unlocking systems. An average person can definitely go for it if they dislike Vivo."
Even a one-star rating is more to it.,1,"  Just after 47 days of purchasing it, I got a problem with the phone. It started to reboot in a loop. Then I took it to the servicing center. The problem was resolved. I wish I could end this happily ever after. But, my happiness didn't last long. Hell! it didn't even last for 2 hours. The very next day I went to the servicing center again, the story repeats. SO I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE, as it's a waste of your time, energy, and money."
Phone,5,  The best phone üìûThis phone was good quality and camera and strogeBest priseNice phone üìû
Overpriced. Go for redmi 9i on Flipkart.,2,  Good battery life but expensive for this price tag as you can get redmi 9i at same price on Flipkart. Both mobiles are same but 9i has 4gb ram & 64gb memory.Go for Redmi 9i on flipkart.3gb ram lags a bit.
Exceptionally cool,5,"  Splendid trendy smart phone, great finish, touch sensors, display in par with more upmarket products.In a budget friendly way, suits basic function, üì∑ is good.Worth the price quoted.Thank you."
Great Mobile with all basic features perfectly matched,5,"  Excellent mobile, bought it for my mother great battery life and nice Camera for the price, My Mother makes phone calls watches YouTube and WhatsApp and she gets nearly 3 days of battery life, she is very happy, small problem is the earpiece sound is a bit low."
Nice phone,5,  Best mobile phone
Device is a pathetic,1,"  The phone quality is best but the performance isn't.The phone gets usually hang within 2 appa running in the background. You can't expect more From this device. I'm using this phone for only Calling purpose for my company sim. I have OP 7 pro for my uses, but this phone is really needs a strong software database, good camera quality, ram performance for smooth use."
Sought of Good Mobile at this price,4,"  The display of the mobile is good enough and battery life is awesome. Camera is you can say OK sought but what to expect in such a low price. A little bit hanging issue due to 2GB RAM , else otherwise everything is good. I got it for Rs.6120 (10% SBI credit Card discount) . You can go for it."

It's made in china,1,"  Don't buy this phone , it's made in China"
1 month with you another at service centre,1,"  Worst phone ever bought. After using for nearly 20 days it stopped taking charge. Service center found mother board fault & change it, after that in play store log in itself it turned off again permanently. 2nd service center visit updated the software & it started working. Now if I use it for 2-3 minutes continuously it restarts. Forget about gaming or any smartphone activity."
Not taking update,1,"  Not taking update for Google Chrome and webview system. I called up Amazon customer care, but they did not respond and behavior of customer executive was very wrost"
Average phone- serves its cost,3,"  Average phone, do not expect too much in case of performance. For first time touch pad buyers, if u have already used better configuration u won‚Äôt like it at all. This phone is to give a budgeted gift. Teenagers better put some more money and buy better one.."
Good product,4,  Quality is good in the price range below Rs 7000  battery does not last long and camera captured quality will be ok if you are looking for high quality camera or high battery back up you need to buy higher version model in higher price segment
A unbeatable budget kingü•∞,5,  Got the product today. I am so much happy with the build quality and look of the phone .No other phone have this asthetic look in this price segment.Camera quality also so good. Main attraction about this phone is its display. It's a big gorgeous HD panel in its segment.Considering all things redmi did a great jobWith 9AGO blindly with this product of your budget is 6999
Hangs a lot with a black screen and stops working,1,  Bought two phines and It's been 7 days only and both the phone starts hanging along with a black screen and then needs a restart.‡•§‡•§Worst part is I am not able to avail servicing facility by amazonAlso brand service is ignoring my complaints

You can watch 720p videoPerformance : No lag in day to day useage .Run smoothly every app.***No heating problemOverall product is good and value for money"
Average android phone,2,"  Heat problem and less battery backup, hope this will be fixed in android update."
good as a gift,4,  this product is for the people who are in search of average smartphone in an average price range. camera is a little average and it feels a little heavy probably due to its 5000Mah battery and large body but performance is good and there is no heat problem over heavy uses even. This is not for gaming purpose but i played lite games and performance was good. Overall good for general purpose.
Just Average product,3,  Its not an i was expecting. The disappointed me this time. As i come camera of redmi and other with same megepixel i found other much better than it. Battery is good you can use it full day and charger is also fast . But for very normal usage you can bought this product but if you are heavy user dont think about it. It lags sometime.
Excellent Phone at affordable price.,5,  The phone is excellent. Super fast charging. Camera is very decent. Screen is bigger than earlier versions of Redmi phone. Highly recommended.Go for it.üëçüëç
nice,5,  This product from redmi is fine under this price but the display is really bad i think so if you are willing to add some more money üí≤ then go for other product
"Terrible Face Unlock, No Fingerprint sensor",1,  1- Display quality sucks. 720p video seems like 480p.2- Cameras are terrific.3- Too much lags.4- Unstoppable Miui ads.5- Face Unlock usually takes 5-10 seconds and most of the time it doesn't work.6- No Fingerprint sensor.7- Battery is draining more quickly and fast charging is also gone after 5 months.Bottom line- Don't buy this Covid phone.
"Wrong Product, fake promises",1,"  Brought a phone only when it was written  it would be manufactured in India, but when it was delivered we got a made in China product ...... Absolutely fake promise by Amazon ...... When I initiated a replacement request there's no one to acknowledge..... Pathetic service.........!!!!!!!"
Network catching problem,4,  Phone is good. But mobile network catching problem very slowly.you tube not open in my mobile.sir I am very sad.please write down my information
Best phone of rs 6500,5,  I think it is the best phone of rs 6500 no othe company can give us so better product as redmi 9a it is very good phone for lite use but if u are a heavy user then u have to excess your range at 10000Sorry not for pubg or freefire users  but helio p25 is a good prossessor........... It also may not for a camera loveThanks for reading .............................. üôè

Made in china,1,"  Made in china, build quality bad, speaker also not good...pls go with redmi 9 or redmi 9 prime made in india version"
Good product for the price but could be better if included a back cover & screen guard,4,  Overall good product nominal peformance for daily tasks but not at all suggested for multitasking or gaming or photography coz AF its a budget phone so just fits right with the regular flow. No back cover & screen guard & takes lot of time to charge

Worst ever I seen.,1,"  Camera quality is not good,touch screen behaves unintended input when you make call by close by ear.Flash Light seems low power.Face locking system is not much better as expectation.No Magnetic Sensor, so you can't use compass feature or app.Some of bluetooth headset v5 doesn't works.*** I will suggest better to go for another ****"
Ok phone but as per price & performance its a little high priced,3,  Frequent call drops happen. Good screen etc & camera quality but battery is not that good especially if you have you are connected to data or wifi most times. Most annoying is the call drops & you have to redial & connect.Overall an OK phone which could have been priced lower with the quality it possesses
Don't purchase this.Go for any other phone .,1,"  The processor is extremely slow , even can't process Chrome browser efficiently .Absolute waste of money ,choppy apps.Camera is a disaster with lot of noise and poor light sensing technologyHigh contrast is visible in photos.Poor quality at low light .Don't purchase thisIf you r still here ,that proves u r dumb to think about purchasing this."
Worth buyable under this price.,4,"  Ordered nature green coloured mobile, Amazon delivered in 2 days. Colour is slightly different (dark) than what is visible on site. Battery performance is superb and processor performance is upto the mark. Indoor pics are not good with its camera."
Good budget phone for students studying online @home,5,  Bought this for someone else whose kids needed a phone with good Wi-Fi connectivity for online studies.Working Gr8 for him!Battery life is quite good..
Phone started rebooting not good,2,"  Phone started rebooting n files got corrupted.In 9 days only, I have to take it to service center.Software needs proper handle of corruption"
Crashed and useless after 2 months,1,"  Worst mobile ever, within 2 months it got cashed. Everyone time i open the mobile it displays MiUi and got shut down. There is no option over Amazon to return/replace after 10 days now, where to complain to who should we reach out there is no clue at all."
"Third Class, too slow, waste of money phone",1,"  I specially recommended you to don't buy this phone. If you're planning to buy for your old parents or uneducated people meaning they will use only RED & GREEN buttons than you can buy otherwise please avoid buying.Too slow and hanging phone, talking about other features meaning insulted them.PURCHASING A FEATURE PHONE WILL BE GOOD INSTEAD OF IT."

Made in China,2,  The product is made in China and how mi is selling in India after the ban of Chinese phones in India.
worst mobile,1,"  Worst mobile ever, primary function of mobile is calling yet this mobile showing unique problem that on calling fellow person doesnt hear voice at all. as well service centre not able to solve problem. worst camera quality ever."
Good entry level device,4,"  I was looking for an entry level budget phone with latest features, this device serves the purpose, natural green color is awesome.  Beware, the device comes with 'Made in China' label."
Not buy 2gb ram,3,  The built quality is good not great if you are buying this please by the 3gb variant which gives more value of you by GB variant it will lag under 2 months
"Entry level, Value for money,",4,"  Battery life is good after use of intense calls, internet and video lasting for 3 days. Camera quality is good for entry level user. Value for money. So far not use for gaming."
Value for old exchange mobile,5,  Good! as purchased this mobile in exchange offer which is the best in deal. Good battery life. Good picture quality. Overall my experience is 10 out of 10. Thanks amazon for this wonderful exchange offer.
After using one month 9A,4,"  It is fully budget phone for mostly aged people to user smart phone, with low cost and high performance.If you want to use for long term and less use of apps and gaming then go for this 9A which is having good battery backup big screen with 3 GB ram etc."
Below average phone,2,"  It is very slow, lags a lot and hangs occasionally. It gets heated up if you use internet for long. No Gorilla glass, no fingerprint sensor, battery backup is good and camera is ok. Big screen with average display and Sound is a bit low. Dual apps and split screen function is missing. Its a low budget phone from Redmi. Go for better options"
Phone is slow,1,"  I found the phone a bit slow and lags in certain areas. Previously, I was using redmi 7a, 2Gb so I thought this phone might a good upgrade. But disappointed."
"Phone for people who uses Youtube, Whatsapp and for calls.",4,"  The product is decent in the price range. If you use the phone moderately only for calls, youtube or WhatsApp, then this is the best phone. I bought it for my mother and she felt happy, The screen is big and the battery is also good only if you use it moderately. Bought it for 6200 rupees."
Mobail so good and camera quality,5,"  Mobail so good and camera quality osm and battrary is so good, fingerprint one touch finger"
Not a good option,1,  1- Mobile is very slow. Skype app buttons response in 15 seconds.2- Touch of mobile is really bad.3- camera is also very poor.4- this mobiles comes with customised os. Which includes lot of third party apps which makes this mobile slow.5- finger or biomateic is not available.
Nice screen,5,  Battery life is good. I've been using it for 2 months now and it's great. It handles all social media apps very well and the calling audio quality is very good.
Terrible phone. Not even value for money.,1,  There is no magnetometer or gyroscope. Compasses wont work and even google map wont show which direction i am facing accurately. I bought it and regretted my purchase within the hour. No value at all for me. There is a lot of false advertising in other review websites which prompted me to get this.
Worth buy,5,  If you want to purchase a mobile under 6.8k it will be a better one. Giant display at 6.8k. Massive battery backup. Bought the mobile for Rs.6120 in great indian festival.
Slow as snail,2,  The phone is super slow. If one is navigating from one app to another it takes 5-6 second to open.If you open chrome it takes 10 second to open.Camera quality is not good (though the expectations from camera was not much).
9a mobile is good another,5,  Premium look..
Think twice.,3,"  Display and camera quality are too poor, else phone is ok, so it's better to spend few more buck for a better experience. However phone is good for new users."
Good From Xiaomi!,5,  Got this for 6400‚Çπ during the sale and feels like it satisfies the price paid for the device! Good product from Xiaomi! Go for it
POOR QUALITY MOBILE,3,"  I have been using the redmi 9A mobile for 7 months. Atfirst I think it will be good mobile, but now it seemed not good. Its scrolling is not smooth, sometimes it hangs, it shows full network signal but doesn't give net speed and even youtube doesn't continue smoothly. I don't play any online games like freefire or others. Camera isn't good. Only one thing is its battery is good."
WiFi hotspot doesn't connect to Laptop,3,"  Handset is fine for daily usage, video calling, zoom meeting etc. But the biggest drawback is its WiFi hotspot doesn't get connected to Laptop. I had tried several troubleshooting but nothing has worked. Really disappointed with this as I need to work on my laptop with internet on."
Not a Good Handset in,2,"  Not a good handset, its very slow and camera quality is not good. It had purchased it for my dad. Sold it back on olx after 1 month. The only best thing is battery. Charges quickly and runs long"
Super,5,  Excellent battery back upFingerprint reader goodCamera quality also good in this range especially capturing in low light.Overall good deal.
I claim replacement of device / smart phone as  this product is under warranty period .,1,"  Our product purchased from Amazon is under warranty , manufacturing defect as wel as battery performance.But sorry to report that while charging the battery of this smart phone ,this device has been fully destroyed due to blast of the battery of smart phone .So plz replace this product with a new one as per the warranty."
Not worth for money,1,"  Camera quality is poor, battery life is better. Don't get fooled by the average ratings. Never go for this. Go for some other phones at this rate please read reviews in another site before buying this phone.  Posting the review for third time. Hope this will get posted this time."
Too slow....not worth it...,1,"  Camera quality is not so good, initially I thought phone is nice. However, after using this, m so frustrated and it's too slow. It's a waste of money. Don't buy this. Once again telling, it's very very slow..... please don't refer my previous comment"
Good for Average user's,4,  In the budget it's worth to buy.Worth to spent every penny.Good design and built.üîã Battery backup is fine
Everything is good except camera quality,4,"  I bought this mobile for my mom, she likes it. Everything is good in this mobile like display, sound, battery life, etc except the camera quality. The quality of the camera is same as the quality in button phone. This is not a problem for my mom because she's not a photo freak."

Awesome budget phone,5,"  Very good , I particularly like the large display and the immense battery ."
Super smartphone for older people (brilliant beginners phone)......,4,"  Decent phone for this price range. But I am not recommend this phone to any youngster who is approaching this phone with an intention to play games. If battery, decent camera (with gcam) are your  main concern then go for it. You can also enjoy other features which normal smartphone offers nowadays."
Worth the price,4,  The handset is good1. Great battery life.2. Display has good pixels.3. Screen is big.4. Ram speed is very fast.5. Camera quality is so so.6. Network hold a lot
Not upto the mark,2,"  It takes nearly 3 hrs to charge fully. And battery draining quickly, though they mention duration hrs as 2 days. Camera quality is ok not that much. And while charging mobile is heat up as I kept in fire.specifications seems to be awesome but disappointed with its working condition. We cannot spend 7k often with these issues."
Best Budget Smartphone at 7499üòç,4,"  If You Want to Buy a budget smart phone then really blindly go for this...With A Good Potrait Camera quality, good processor,3gb ram n of course a large battery backup almost 2 days battery life if you are a normal user. It doesn't have fm radio n gorilla glass protection overall it is a budget smart phone at 7500.Go for this"
Good phone,5,  I tried for 3 GB RAM phone but unfortunately got only the 2 GB one. Memory is the only one constrain noticed.
Long term review,3,  Happy with EMI option as it made the purchase affordable.Thanks Amazon.Product is good value.Would have liked a hard case to be bundled.The Micro USB charging port is cumbersome(User is a Senior Citizen)Would have preferred a non Chinese brand.

Best mobile phone in that price range,4,  Great phone at that price point. Other leading brands do not offer these specs in that price range. Well built and really lightweight phone. Love the color though. Long battery life. Great for kids to attend online classes.
"Value for money,",5,"  Overall good product at this price point, Xiomi claiming made in India product, but we received made in China, I had never thought that I will get made in China product. It's very disappointing for me, Amazon delivering most of product  made in China."

Battery problem.Not  switch on the mobile,1,  After 18 days my redmi9A is not working .I am totally disappointed totally waste of money right now what to do I dnt know
Five star,5,  I have been using Redmi smartphone for the last 3 years. This one I bought for my mother. She likes it very much. Redmi never disappoints me.
Good,4,"  The ph is good latest os but no light for notification I had old Redmi model which had it,They have written 10w fast charger in box but I got 5w only."

Worst experience. Amazon please take off this mobile version and don‚Äôt sell this kind of faulty mobile versions . Be aware guys Don‚Äôt buy this and save ur money .
Very bad product,1,  Product is very bad. Mobile is heating up very much and screen colour changes after using it for ten days. Some heat waves comes out from the mobile. First time I received such a bad product from Amazon.
Nice phone.,5,"  The phone has a good battery backup (normal use) and nice design.The camera is okay. One problem that I noticed is that: the system apps use internet even the data is disabled. So, I have disabled the mobile data for all apps to avoid losing balance(since no data pack is active in that SIM)."
Decent Phone for a Decent Price,4,  There will always be Pros and Cons even if you buy a lac phone but for this price it justifies the quality and features fairly
"Long battery life, great functionality and fast",4,"  Good, easy to use, functional phone with good speed and apps. I need to charge only twice a week which is awesome. The camera quality is just average or a bit under but that is not why I bought this phone. Other than the picture/video qlty, everything else is awesome. Great value for money."
Good colour and designed,5,  It's battery life and memory are remarkable. It's a great experience to use a redmi phone in this price. It's really a great product
Worth the price!,4,"  Thank you Amazon for delivering the product superfast. The Redmi 9A mobile is worth the price. Not much expectations from the range yet it functions optimum. Good battery, smooth operation, easy AI response for camera and good processing speed."
Nice,3,"  This phone only for simple usage persons or children, don't expect high performance but best in this price segment"
I lost my trust in MI.,1,  I lost my trust in MI.I really dilike its quality. Means this phone is hanging since the day i start using it.Toally dissastisfied with it .Waste of money!Waste of efforts!I will never every buy any phone of MI. As it hangs.
Best Phone in 7K price range!,5,"  If you ask for one word to describe Redmi 9A it is 'smooth'. It functions effortlessly with 3GB RAM, and every feature sails without nay trouble. Camera is the only con, but how much can one expect in this price range. Well done, Redmi."
Nice phone in this budget,4,  Battery is very very good and other features is also very good in this price. Only negative thing in this phone is weight
Value for money,2,  Value for money but it goes to hanging mode many times.  Had to update the Android.  After that it started working well but it keeps happening. That is irritating.
Camera is cheap n worst but average  phone is good,3,"  With camera not happy, another brand in this range gives good AVG camera ,but all avg it is working well ,writing this after using this phone for 3 months"
Value for money,4,  Due to 2GB ram and pre installed redmi apps the phone is bit laggy but as per price and brand its good. Go for nature green colour its awesome!
Probably the best we can get in this price range,5,"  Got it for my mom, she uses it for over 8h at a stretch, and still has quite a battery life. Redmi has been improving monstrously. The camera quality is so so, but we don't aim for professional photography with it so doesn't bother, performance wise it's the best in this price range"
overall good experience,3,  what do you expect in this price range?. mi has bundled pretty much everything in it. plus blue is also my favourite color so if you are planning to buy it just go for it. good phone at this price range.
Go For It. üôÉ,4,  Truth about this PhonePros:1. Amazing Battery life.2. Decent Camera.3. Android 10.4. Big Screen.5. Sexy look.6. Low price.7. Dedicated Micro Sim Slot.cons:Nothing as the price rage is low. You can not get everything in this price.

BUDGET PHONE,4,"  Product seems genuine. Battery backup as of 4 days seems excellent.Hassle free performance, except for lagging and heating issue at times. Perfect fit for this budget , especially if you are planning to get it for someone who has never used a smartphone, as it's very much user friendly."
Price should be less,3,  Ok product overall. Camera is not upto the mark. Good display. Average sound quality. Body color is slightly different from shown in the ad. I think price should be below 7k
Free Fire,5,  Nice phone so smooth and a nice and enhanced gaming experience.Camara is good in AI qualityNice in this budget

Low budget best mobile but 1 problem,4,  Ossam mobile features in low budgets. All good but YouTube showing 720p maximum and other mobile 360p quality better than 720p qyality on this mobile. But low price main sub kuch expect nehi kar sakte he. Others all good.
Not expected this,1,  I ordered this phone for first time. But 2 gb ram is not sufficient for lagre apps but it can be used for low size apps. Not many apps can be used at a time. Camera is decent.I hate adds which comes whenever we install apps.
Best phone for this price segment,5,  This is the only phone for this price segment and a best suggestion my me. The camera quality is decent and not bad at night any how its worth for the money paid. As provoed big display and dot notch are great for this price and I appreciate it. The power back up with 5000mah is good.
Budget friendly phone under 7.5K bracket,5,"  For a Mid tier phone, it packs every feature that you can except for a phone. The phone does not have a fingerprint sensor given the price it is acceptable. Have a good battery life.So far so good."

"Not fit for students, this product deserves for parents and grandparents",3,"  This phone is useful for the one who doesn't uses phone much like parents , grandparents, etc.... (only if your parents or grandparents are not highly educated) as camera quality is very poor , processor is low end , doesn't fit for large graphic games ."

Problem not happy,1,  Problem im not happy
Don't buy this phone,1,  Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
One of the good choice for low budget phone,4,  If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
Bad camera and made in China,1,  Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
Simply excellent. Read complete review written after my 30 days of experience,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."

Value-For-Money & Recommended for a normal user,4,"  I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
Poor,1,  Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
Dont buy it as lower model is good then this,3,"  Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
BUDGET WORTHY PHONE,5,  Nice phone.. overall performance is just amazing
Poor processor basic UI also lagging,3,"  COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"

Please..... üôè don't Buy. Cheapest product from MiüëéDon't Believe in Paid Adverstiment,1,"  Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. üòû. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone üì±, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% üòÄ. The phone is too lightweight ‚ò∫Ô∏è and very handyüòÑ Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. üòÉ.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. üò≠GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. üò†üò†.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. üò•. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good üëçBut it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. üò†Display quality is too poor. üò´ Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. ü•∫  No led in front of the display.üò∞Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection üò•If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or aboveü§ó with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."

Winner of the caparison by price is the realme.,3,  REALME batter than redmi now
Value for Money. Well done Redmi.,5,"  1. Display is excellent. Colors and sharpness is good.2. Descent cameras according to price.3. In hand feel of phone is good. It's slim and despite 5000 Mah battery, it feels light.4. Battery backup is good. Easily last one day.5. Performance is good according to price. Mediatek G25 does it job well. You can play COD and FREE FIRE easily at low settings.6. Speaker loudness is average but quality is good.7. MIUI 12 experience is amazing. No ads and reduced bloatware."

nice product,4,  Quite goodBattery and build quality is betterBut camera and speakers are okok.
Over all Ok,4,"  Advantage :3GB+32 For Rs. 7498/-With 6.5 Inch & 5000 mah Battery Acceptable.Disadvantage :*No Finger Print Sensor*Front Camera is 5 MP Only, if it's 8 MP & Rear Side 13+5 MP means little acceptable.Over all Ok."
Redme 9A,3,  No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
Best under budget phone,5,  Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
Smooth and satisfying,5,"  Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
Good but not up to the mark,3,  Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
Awesome loved it,5,  It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
Excellent phone,5,"  Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
Stopüî¥üî¥üî¥,2,  Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
Cons and Pros,3,"  This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ‚ô•Ô∏è no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
Goooooooood,3,  Weary good product  very fast delivery
Points to be noted,3,"  Points to be noted:üëâ The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.üëâ This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.üëâ Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.üëâ Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.üëâ After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
Made in china,2,  Phone is good. But it is made in China
Best phone for PARENTS. 5/5 for Rs.6800,5,"  Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
Best in this price range,5,  Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
Wow,5,  Wow
Very worst,1,"  I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
Good,4,"  Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
Screen resolution is not good & worst camera ever.. rest so so..,2,  Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
Value for money or not?,4,"  So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5‚≠ê for thatPros-‚Ä¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this range‚Ä¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.‚Ä¢Good for basic usage.‚Ä¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:‚Ä¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)‚Ä¢Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"
Average,3,  A little bit slow..I think it will more lagged afterwards..Big screen.Camera is not good.. As well as selfie..Ph is For normal users..
Not up to the mark,1,  Not satisfied. No camera perfection. No finger sensor. Perfect China piece. Cheap and worst. Started hanging.
Nice deal in this price,3,  Pros-A big batteryBig screenGood lookNice processorValue for moneyCons-Poor camera quality both front and backDoesnt charge fastNo finger print sensor
Good entry level phone.however check what ur getting into,4,"  Good entry level phonePros: Big screen, MIUI12, Good batterly last for more than a day with average use,good cameraCons: single rear camera, no Corning glass screen,No radio, plastic back, 10w charger in box- takes long time to charge"
Lovely love you,5,  Lovely low budget mobile love u redmi nice look mobile

Best phone under 7k no one can compitate,5,  Best phone you can get at this segment totally worth the amount you are paying
Don't buy this product,1,  Do not buy this phone Pretty slow the battery is not powerful Battery is equivalent to 3000 mah battery of other micromax phones.No screenguard/Headphone and case provided The speaker is inferior quality .Lots of eco sound.The processor is pretty slow.The video quality is also not up to mark
Scree size is too much narrow like 5 inch.  Mobille,1,  It's.  Cheating screen size 6.53 but too much narro . You can use only about 5 inch . And company has not write Anny pllace about screenn width size.6.53 is cover is in. Lenth ..So polease do not buy if. You want a big sacree mobile

Best in it's price range,4,"  Mobile looks good and it's worth the price. Cheap and best of its price range. Camera quality is very bad, but in this price we can't expect much. I suggest for basic usage.. one can prefer this product . Like for online classes and other academic purposes."
"Waste of money, Worst customer service.",1,"  I am never going to buy any electronic product from amazon anymore. Experienced worst customer service. Product is not upto the mark. Over heating, network connectivity issue was there. They were using their aaps to dignose in which everything will be showing normal. The same aap can not be used in any other phones for checking. That means this aap is specifically designed by amazone for amazon bought mobiles. You will never know if this is correct or not. Based upon that refund/ replancement will not be done. Amozon update your customer service otherwise if customers make you customers can also break you. After 2 days of continuos chasing no result. Wasted Rs 7498/-."

Good price product,4,  Good product
Not recommended and a cheating,1,"  Amazon is now becomes a cheater, there is no way to return the item..it has below shortcomings..Poor Camera quality, though it has feature for Portrait and Landscape but in landscape mode the clicked pictures are blurred...Poor battery performance, the 5000mAh battery is so poor that it significantly heats up entire phone within  2-5 minutes and drains the battery. Weight is also quite more.I tried to return the item, it says have a test with some software or talk to technical team (after uploading no. of things, very tedious), there are many sites in which you can have hassle free return...You will get frustrated and defiantly could not be able to return the item..there is no way to interact on email and call..so select the items very very carefully..otherwise they are sitting there to cheat your hard earned money...be careful.."

"VoLte, VoWifi Not working!!",1,"  With Airtel Sim, neither VoLte and VoWifi are working in my phone. Airtel Thanks app is showing your handset is 4G but not VoLte compatible. Same thing in Vodafone. Is anyone else having this issue? Asked for replacement. Let's see what amazon do with this issue!Update: After my complaint, Amazon replaced my phone with a brand new piece. But the same issue happened with it also. So again I complained and I am so thankful to Amazon that they took my phone back and told me that they will refund my money. Phone was taken back, just waiting for my refund now.If you have a Jio sim, just go for it. It is an awesome phone but If you are Airtel or Vi customer then there will be some issue with VoLte and VoWifi."

We buyers must also do our homework before buying a high-tech product.,1,"  I want to share a live (semi-positive) experience with Amazon a week back. I purchased a Redmi 9A phone for my grandson on 21 Dec. The phone came on 24th, but wouldn't boot. I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't bootü•µAnother round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN üò¢üò¢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day‚ùóMoral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier üôè"
China DESH KA PHONE......,3,"  Why do you advertise this phone as DESH KA SMARTPHONE. Did you know, What is the meaning of DESH?. I thought of buying a phone by made in India. But Amazon delivered to me a phone by made in China. Not just the phone, the charger and charging cable are made in China!. If we buy a smartphone at a discount, will you behave substandard manner?"

Video Audio quality.,4,"  Phone is good and battery backup is very nice,working long time. But one thing i faced that i bought on first sale i found one problem that video recording audio not good very low hearing then i returned that one and get change  with new. After getting new one i found that problem is same and that not problem its phone problem. Phone video recording audio is very low compare to others phone. I can't hear clear voice in even low distance recording."
Best for Average usage.,5,"  Overall mobile is good for an average usage. Its camera, audio quality is average to good. Its performance is very good because of good internal storage.Handy as well as the screen is quite wide and provides good viewing angle.Plus point is its battery which is quite huge. Has microusb slot and charger is of 10W thats why charging might be somewhat slow (not that fast)If you want the mobile for an average usage then this can be a best deal for you.I got this 2gb Ram 32gb Rom varient in 6800 Rs.Or if your usage is high i would recommend to go for some other Redmi products for price beyond 8000 to 9000.Below 7000 this product gives satisfactory performance."
Leaves a sour taste,1,"  Pros:1. Performance is Ok, for the price.2. 2 SIM + 1 Micro SD Card Slot, i.e. no hybrid slotsCons:1. Too many advertisements and installs 3rd party apps forcefully. This is not mentioned in the listing. This should be made mandatory. But thankfully practically almost everything can be uninstalled.2. Micro USB port for charging is unacceptable in 20213. Used a MIUI based phone long time ago, somehow I feel it has become much worse and confusing. Even changing your notification sound or ringtone takes some effort and a little bit of scratching your head. They should include a manual LOL."
Very Nice budget phone.,5,"  Ordered Redmi 9A 3GB 32GB version, sky blue for my mother 2 days ago. Delivery was quick. The delivery guy also opened the package on request for assurance. Got the product as ordered.Initial impressions:Pros:Large screen, Nice color, good processor, ample RAM for daily normal user, good battery backup, drains very gradually even if you are on calls whole day. Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions. (Very good in daylight or external use.)One of the best phones available in the market at this price. I have given it 5 star for specifications in this price range. I ordered it with an offer.. More than what you can get from any other Indian brand in 7000 rs."
"Very Fast, Superb Video Calling Clarity",5,"  I was using iPhone 6s Plus and when I got this phone for Rs. 7,500, I was surprised ! It have more display clarity and camera clarity than my iPhone. Also it is as fast as my iPhone. Mi have combined All features of ios and Android in this Phone, that make this phone special compared to other Android Phones. Its OS is Mi modified version of Android. The modified version is very intelligent and smart. It have removed all the disadvantages of Android Phones. It have iPhone features like Face unlock, time lapse video, burst mode and exposure increase and decrese in camera etc.Sound clarity also superb.My Brother in the US have amazed to see the better clarity of video calling than my previos iPhone."

Value for money.,5,  Just now received phone. First look great design and display size at this price tag. Speed for normal usage is looks fine. Overall value for money.
Basic android smartphone,5,"  A basic android smartphone for basic android experience. If you're looking for an entry level smartphone with android os then this is a phone for you. This model packs a 3gb ram and 32gb internal storage which is more than sufficient for your daily needs from Facebook to YouTube and anything in between. If you want a basic android experience or just want a phone for your daily driver this one is for you. Do note this ain't optimal for heavy duty gaming. Casual gaming yes, but not heavy duty gaming."

"Most pathetic product - BE warned - DO NOT BUY !!! Battery, Memory and Bandwidth hogging phone.",1,"  This is the most pathetic product that I have ever had the misfortune to buy on Amazon - and you cannot return the product and hope to exchange it for something else because they do not permit ""RETURNS"" only ""REPLACEMENT""  - WITH THE SAME GODFORESAKEN PHONE!!!!!""It comes preloaded with MIUI and other inefficient memory, bandwidth  and battery draining bloatware and constant advertisements all over the place  - and there is no way you can disable them - by buying this phone you are compromising your data and security and paying for an advertiser to constantly bombard you with adverts for thoroughly useless products -  and you have to pay for the bandwidth he uses up.In an attempt to get rid of MIUI you cannot even flash a custom ROM like LineageOS or some of the other AltROMs cause the manufacturers of the device will not share the code. SO IF YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS DEVICE YOU ARE STUCK.Do not buy - if you happen to have paid for it then your fate is sealed - you cannot hope for a refund ---- better to spend that money on buying some cow dung - might help make a cow happy!"
Nice Phone for doing normal works,3,"  This phone is helpful in basic things, camera quality is not good at all, specially rear camera is not good it is really a 8mp camera but Redmi is saying it 12 or 13 MP...making fool to customers. Overall it is good for taking online classes, making calls, using whatsapp but not for gaming, you can play normal games but if you play games like free fire, it starts heating and lagging. Battery is actually 4800 mAh.."
"Durable phone, worth every single rupee!",5,"  I ordered the phone during amazon 1-month deepawali sale, when it was selling for Rs 6,800. I exchanged my old Redmi phone and got further Rs 3,600 off. Plus I made the purchase using HDFC Bank credit card and got 10% cashback. Net net, i got the phone for Rs 3,150.But buying the phone at a cheap price wasn't the highlight. Its performance has not disappointed me.The features have upgraded and the Redmi-9A offers more bang for the buck. Features are intuitive and easy to use. My contact list was restored in no time.The 13MP camera is really good and, in my opinion, as good as an iPhone. I am exploring the phone's features and it has been a pleasant experience for me.If you are looking to upgrade your phone then PLEASE DON'T LOOK FURTHER!Rajagopalan VBengaluru"
Worth for the money,5,  Worth for the money.. I dont see similar features in other brand for this price range. My parents liked it very much... Wish they added some headphones to this. The color really pop's I was little hesitant while ordering about the color. But it's beautiful üòçüòçüòç
DEFECTIVE PRODUCT RECEIVED,1,"  The bad news was that I received a defective piece (what I feared the most because many customers posted review about defect). The good news was that my refund was processed on the same day as I filed the complaint with picture proof as attached here as well and I received the refund amount within 3 days.Plus, there were these black parallel horizontal lines on the screen, which I just couldn't understand why it was there. The phone looked pretty good (colour and built wise). Maybe would have been a nice one if I hadn't received a defective product."
JUST GO FOR IT.. ü§©,5,"  Amazing phone in such a low price.Great don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick face recognition, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have dual Or tripple cameras because its single camera beats most of the dual and triple camera phones, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick and last thing don't think like its cheap so obviously it will have poor looks and downgraded, no in this phone this isn't the case. Overall I'll give full stars and attaching some samples which have been slightly edited with In built editor.."
Excellent Price!,4,"  I bought this phone in the sale for a ridiculously low price. Firstly if you are someone who uses a lot of apps then this phone is not for you. It is a basic android phone which can be used for photos, WhatsApp and a few others. For the price, one shouldn't expect more. If you load a lot of apps expect the phone to go slow.The build quality was surprisingly excellent and the call quality was also good. Watching videos was also good.Frankly, for this price, I cannot complain about anything.Excellent buy in my opinion."
A good exchange offer,4,"  Pros. 1. This was bought on exchange offer, and I got a good price for my old phone. The exchange was smooth and there were no issues. Was very happy with the transaction.2. I have had it for just two weeks. So I cannot comment on durability, etc. No problem so far. Everything is as described on the Amazon page.3. The phone looks good and I am happy with the purchase.Cons.  Because it was an exchange transaction, the phone was not delivered as fast as for a full cash transaction. I ordered on 25 January and got the phone on 6 February. But I was kept updated about possible delivery dates, etc. So I was not worried.All in all, well worth it."
Good product,4,  The product is good in this price range and as a xiaomi lover you can buy it
Cheap phone with lots of incorrect details,2,  The camera provided in the phone is not  13mp at all.Picture quality is not good and it does not reflect the true colors.its ok that it is a cheap phone but atleast they should mention the correct configuration. If you compare camera picture quality with nokia phones I must say that 2mp camera in nokia made phones have better picture quality that 13mp of this phone. Its OK that this is vewry cheap phone but customer should not think that they will get a 13mp camera. Samsung or nokia make phones with 8mp camera might have better picture quality.rest i can write once i use this phone for a month.
Good and affordable,5,  Very cool phone at this price and camera is average but overall I would recommend choose Redmond over realme
An attractive deal and a reliable phone,4,"  I bought this phone on the amazon prime sale. It was a great deal will a of discounts and I was able to buy it for under ‚Çπ9,000. I've been using this phone for almost a month now and here are my feedbacks.Firstly the good points. Very sleek, good screen size and the menus are user friendly. It has face unlock, pattern and pin unlock as well but no biometric. I can't be asking for more features for this price. 2 sim trays and one SD card tray which is great. I had been using both sim trays form this phone.Now for the bad points. I'm not able to set 2 different ring tones for each sim. So when a call comes in you can only tell by looking at the screen showing on which sim I am getting the call. Next, Screen brightness is not that great. On a bright sunny day, its sometimes not bright enough even if you turn brightness to the highest. Hotspot works fine but you cannot see how many devices are connected. Moreover, you also cannot see which device is connected. Then there are those unwanted, useless Mi apps that comes standard in the phones that send you notifications to upgrade and install even though those apps have not been updated by me.These are the major points. Apart from this, there seems to be no other issues. For a secondary phone this phone is great. Value for money."
Upgraded version of Basic Mobile,2,"  In the name of ""Budget"" phones, quality and features of the mobile is compromised. The camera quality is very poor. Adding to it, the mobile is full of bloatware which reduces the speed of the mobile. Most irritating is ads everywhere - In music, App explorer, Homescreen, in lock mode, wallpaper. You name it and there is an add"
Good quality under budget,4,"  Good product for budget price rangeBut camera quality is average otherwise, value for money  product"
Good,5,"  Happy to buy this good mobile , but little bit specs missing but value for money"
Worst experience,1,  Worst mobile within 10 days we got sound problem. Whatever I am playing no sound at all. After 10 days no return policy.
Dublicate product,1,  One of the Cheapest Chinese product in this category again. It is mentioned as 5000 mah battery in the specification but actually it is not upto the mark. Actually I bought this phone for my father as it has a bigger battery. But it drains automatically within 2 days when there is no usage. But redmi 8A which I am using presently is much better product when compared to this product.I don't know whether XIOMI is prescribing wrong speciation or AMAZON is selling a dublicate product. But my suggestion is don't buy this product even when you have little usage.
9a,5,  ùêçùê¢ùêúùêû
Decent product for its price!,4,"  Best choice for low budget.BATTERY:It is upto use. If you use light apps and its normal function battery last upto 5-6 hours approx.#Using heavy apps(games) definately hange the device and heat it up.CAMERA:Looking at its price camera is decent . Quality is not too good, but can capture your precious moments at a decent quality.WEIGHT:Weight is light easy to handle .Looks nice.VIDEO QUALITY:The experience is not that hd  but gives you a nice experience. Sound quality is also good.It doesn't have fingerprint sensor , there is no back cover."
For the price it is ok..,3,  A good phone for the price.Seems little bit lagging. Back camera good but front camera pathetic. Not good for elderly people because bit bulky.Display is ok. Some of the apps like Google nearby sharing and files go app file sharing is not working.For the price range it is ok..Auto display brightness is crappy..
Overall good phone for daily use but go for 3gb variant.,4,"  Phone is good those who want a decent phone for daily use but first of all turn off all annoying ads they provide. No doubt on built quality, it is solid, durable. Battery life is very good. Camera gets the job done for daily use. I have 2gb variant which I won't recommend for others because I can feel slight lag if 4 apps are in the background, Go for Poco C3 3gb variant as it is the same brand of Mi,also it has better processer n u get 500rs discount on HDFC debit card. I trust Mi for long term use, I never had bad experience. Thumbs up if you find this helpful."
Good in use,4,  Smart use

Purchased the 3GB/32GB Nature Green Redmi 9A at Rs. 7499,4,  Purchased the Nature Green colour case on 23 Feb 2021 and was delivered on 25 Feb 2021. I've used it for a good couple of weeks and reviewing this purchase on 09 March 2021.It's value for money. The Camera quality is good and battery life is long as well.Actually I've placed another order for the Sea Blue colour one today.I also purchased mobile case and tempered glass with this purchase. below are the detailsBracevor Hybrid Back Cover Kickstand Case for Xiaomi Mi Redmi 9A and JGD PRODUCTS¬Æ Tempered Glass for Redmi 9A-Edge to Edge Full Screen Coverage.
Pathetic Phone,1,"  Product is below average. This is third Mi phone that I bought and all the three have had network (card) problems. Camera clarity is good but takes 10 sec to launch.. again, poor experience. Battery is good, but compared to other phones in this range, it take double the time to charge... hence the fast charging option too is not at par.Overall A very poor experience with Mi phones. I'll never buy Mi phone in future and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE."
Don't Buy This!!!,3,"  I ordered this phone day after today and it has been delivered to me. I did not like this phone at all because this phone heats up quickly and the sound of the phone speaker is also very low. Therefore, I would suggest that you spend more than 2000 rupees. And buy other smartphones of Realme.But in this MRP it is good"
Fantastic Smartphone .....,5,  Good Smartphone in low budget lover for normal use.I gifted to my wife and she is very happy with phone and it's colors.I received within 4 days.Redmi needs to price 7000 with fingerprint function.Thanks
Good inexpensive phone,3,"  It comes with 2GB of RAM. The Redmi 9A runs Android 10 and is powered by a 5000mAh non-removable battery. The Redmi 9A supports proprietary fast charging. As far as the cameras are concerned, the Redmi 9A on the rear packs a 13-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture.Redmi 9A is not the best choice when choosing an inexpensive smartphone. It got a lot of flaws. On the positive side of Redmi 9A, there are high-quality assembly and materials of use. Also, the screen size is larger, decent battery life"
Good and worth it.,4,"  Got delivered on time. Best budget level phone. Has good outer body design with attractive colour.Specs are good and user interface is smooth and lag free.Cameras are okay, not great. Yes it has a AI mode for better usage.Gets warm while using but no heating issue. Came with 55% battery charge.Overall a good buy in this price range."
Overall good product,3,  Battery quality superb at this rate .long lasting.camera quality is not good as I thought.average camera.display is perfect. Not useable for gamers.aged people can use.overall good phone.kindly press the helpful button
Good mobile at 7k range,4,"  I bought this mobile to use it for calling purpose ,just needed an extra mobile for me. It comes with 3 gb ram and 32 gb hd., Which is suffice to me. Its a good phone for basic necessities like calling, browsing and apps, not a good camera, no fingerprint reader, battery life is good, charging is fast. It's a value for money if you looking at a mobile with 7k range with big screen size and 3 gb ram."
Don't Purchase this product...,1,  Issue started within 10 days of purchase of this product. My phone doesn't charge inspite keeping in charging for 2 hours.Amazon gave us 07 days replacement but the issue started on 10th day. Spoken to the team denied replacement of the product told us to go redmi service gallery for any issue. Now have to keep all my work aside and have to run behind the gallery people to get my phone repaired..Highly disappointed with the services from Amazon ..Worst Worst Product Don't buy people...

"Horrible phone, slow and freezes very often. My previous phone redmi 7A was much better",1,"  Horrible phone, slow and freezes very often. My previous phone redmi 7A was much better.Pros:Superb battery lifeBig screen (useful for browsing)Sturdy phone, has fallen a few times, nothing brokeConsDisplay resolution is badCamera is patheticHangs very often , when switching between apps"
Beaware!!!,5,"  In description, mention that the mobile is manufacturing by Rising Stars Mobile india pvt. Ltd., that is India, But see the picture, there mention Made in China.As per my coversation with Amazon as follows:1. Firstly they say...the batch or the lot which you have received possibly it's a old one.Me: how is this possible, after lunch, i purchase this phone on 2nd sale. How it could be old one.2. Amazon: From now onward the same product we are providing to our customers it's ""manufacturing in India"" this information is mentioned on the box itself.Me: what is this means, from now onward...Means previously manufactured in china or actual manufactured in china, there after comes to india and just replace the sticker.How is possible, a product made in India and print on that item other country name.I think they make people to fool and make money, just writing MADE IN INDIA.I request to you also, those are purchased this item please check the truth.And lastly this is possible on mobile/ any other products, those we cheated by amazon."
GOOD BUDGET PHONE,4,"  Redmi 9A is one of the most affordable smartphone by Redmi. It is available in two variants of 2GB + 32GB model priced at Rs. 6,799, while the 3GB + 32GB variant carries a price tag of Rs. 7,499.I Purchased on 23rd Sep.20.l expect it will be good. It is in great  demand. I think it's a good budget  Phone."
Very bad,1,  I hope these reviw help those who want to buy it is not good pohne at all as it hangups a lot for daily usade event the pohne also does not ha a type c which is downgraded. If you want to take these pohne it is bad opt even the delivery services also sucks and very bad service from amazon even i dont want to give single star also
Front camera is very disappointing during nightlights.,3,"  Overall it is a very budget phone.In 6799 it is offering 6.5 inch screen. Screen is good and HD. I don't expect much from this phone as I have gifted it to my wife,so no need of high end multitasking and speed performance but its front camera is very disappointing during night. It shows very blurry pictures in night. The dot dots are very much visible while taking pictures at night, just like a classic phone cameras of 2005 2010. I have used many MI phones ,the cameras was upto the mark,but this time its very disappointing.I was so disappointed with the camera that I ordered replacement but I cancelled it soon for not taking the headache of setting up the phone again. I think it wasn't the single piece defect. There's a degraded quality front camera in redmi 9A. In daytime there's no issue but it is not meant for pictures in nightlights."
Worst,1,  This is hanging a lot and they don't return it ..... Just replace the product worst phone don't go for it
Too Good to Handle in Daily life,5,  thanks Amazon for so good product at best price in the marketphone is very big size screen and 3 GB RAM is totally smooth function to operatecamera is too good and quality is goodall the functions are working properly and the best thing is that it has very nice grip in the back side
Hanging,1,"  Believe the review its hang much.Even in the calling tab when you touch on the search people it takes time.2gb ram what a joke its not even working like 1gb.My old redmi note 3 (2017) works greater than thisThis is so irritating.If you have budget issue, I will suggest you to buy other brand. if you want to buy only redmi then I will suggest you to don't buy any redmi phone that's falls under 10000."
Not much expected,3,  Camera quality is not much expected. Battery backup and screen size is good
Nice Phone in 2300 because i got it in a exchange of my old realme c2,3,"  Nice Phone in 2300 for me in exchange my realme c2Pros to be considered :-Camera -3.5* , nice picture in 13mp don't compare to 48 or 64 at this price i think it's better than my previous phone the photos look naturalDisplay - 4*  ,6.5 inch 720p big and nice display but could have been little brighterProcessor - 3*. The g25 is decent for daily useag but, They could have provided g35 atleast but in day to day nice performance , normal game running without any problem.Battery - 3.5* , battery life is nice can run whole day with normal and some gaming no problem but one issue they said it was 5000mah battery but if you check in any Phone information app on Google Play they show only 4100mah battery so you can check yourselfCons  to be considered:-Now there is no gyroscope or electronic compass in sensors , no or blaster ,no type c , no fingerprint sensor.In 7k i would not recommend this phone redmi 7a is much better deal or realme c3 , but since i got it in a exchange of only 2300 rupees i think it's bang for buck deal for me, but GST are increased to 18% so if you buy any 10000 phone you will pay 1800 or 2k to tex in government so smartphone prices are increased dramatically , that's why they are no longer value for money phone in smartphone market right now.Amazon service is really incredible for exchange, i try to exchange my phone through flipkart but they denied for no reason they have fraud exchange policy. But i have very nice experience with Amazon service , the delivery boy was good too ,Thanks for fantastic service Amazon.Thanks for your time and reading this long review.I will update later"
Super phone...,5,"  Phone looking is very niceBattery back up is very niceIn this price range ,this mobile is goodBut camara is not that much good but okNot coming any case along with mobile,they should have provided case.Over all mobile is very nice..."
Good,5,  Amazing product with this price
Go for it!,5,  The phone is good to give an elder person who does not need a very powerful phone. It's also gotta  large  screen that apt for reading. I say go for it as a budget phone. Gifted it to my mother... She is not the least bit tech savvy. I have not tried any heavy gaming on it so cannot say.The daylight photos are stunning and clear. Have not checked not time pictures.The charger get the phone charged pretty quick.Using it for fifteen days.Go for it!
A downgrade over Redmi 8A. Not worth it.,3,"  When you consider its predecessor the 8A/8A Dual, this one is a major downgrade. A sluggish Helio chipset, Type B charging port, an unnecessarily tall screen, bad camera all combine to deliver a not so VFM product. I am saying this coz I have the 8A Dual as well... Not impressed. With every series, there are too many compromises which is very much unlike Redmi"
Great value for money with low budget,4,  It doesn't comes with fingerprint sensor althought phone has massive battery with decent processors.charging around 2.5 hrs to complete from 0 to 95%. I didn't face any bugs right now. Made of this phone is excellent build quality and big screen added much advantage  it comes with 10w mi charger not supports fast charging.
Value for your money,3,  Value for money....Mediatec processor is bit slower.. dont expect a good cam..Frond cam was good  ...A good phone for older people who did not use much apps...6800 INR
Not so good,3,"  Camera quality is not as per the expectations, with 13 mp you get better camera quality but this phone has bad camera quality pics along with phone volume very less. Average phone i would say for regular use but doesn't justify it's specifications."
Radmi 9A,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
It sucks,1,"  Within 4 months of buying this phone, the storage was full. I didn't get even half of the 32 gb this phone bragged about. And that's all because of the useless pre-installed apps this phone comes with that no one, NO ONE, needs. I can't get rid of those stupid Xiaomi apps. This sucks. Never buying from Xiaomi again."
Good for below average users.,3,  The performance is not as good as specified in the discription. Camera parameters are good but the picture is not as good as it should be with these specifications. Overall it is good for below average users. But don't think of playing games on it as it hangs even on playing simple games like subway surfers. Battery is good and lasts about a day.
JUST A SIMPLE PRODUCT. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH,4,  To be frank it is a good product for the priceYou can't expect too much from it‚Ä¢The camera is ok type but not much features in editing the photos‚Ä¢There too many in built apps but they can be removed if not required‚Ä¢The screen is not bright at all its really dull to see‚Ä¢good delivery by amazon‚Ä¢Only good thing is that you get 3gb with 32 GB storage and a really big screen‚Ä¢It is good for people who don't expect much from their mobiles and use phones for a basic necessity‚Ä¢If you are looking for more features then I do not recommend this you have other options in this price‚Ä¢You also need to buy a cover and screen protector‚Ä¢The box only has the phone with charger and the manual with invoice of bill
Better to not to purchase MI products,1,  I am writing this review after 6 months....After 6 months phone was automatically restart & some time it will go to off mode it may takes 1 or 2 day's to  come back to on mode.... Service center guys saying bord issue but this boar was not available now....
Worth!,4,"  In this price, this is perfect smartphone for a beginner or senior citizens.**Camera quality is not good as expected. Basic front camera. Rear camera is ok.**No fingerprint scanner, but thank god Face unlock is there.****Good thing is display size and quality.üëç"
Redmi 9A 3GB RAM RS. 7499 AMAZON'S DELIVERY IS SUPERB üëç,2,"  Batteryüîãis ok, camera is worstüëé  you will receive only 20Gb approx to use rest Will be filled with Preinstalled mi apps,Amazon delivery is very fast ‚ö° but mobile quality is not upto the markGiving two ‚≠ê‚≠ê only for Amazon"
Overall good... üòç,5,"  I personally really like this smart phone at this price...  The camera quality is good... As we know the  more camera quality the more price... It is even light weight....By the way I really like it..  I recommend everyone who is finding the smartphone at that price,  he or she should bye.....But about one thing in this phone  I am disappointed,  it is the fingerprint scanner..Over all perfect even I have no words to say.. üòÄüòÖüòç..Value of money....Please click on helpful,  if you found it helpful..  Amazon service well an good .."
Great Phone at this Budget and Ultra Fast Delivery.,5,"  I really Love Redmi Phones. My First Phone was Redmi 8A. I bought this phone as a Gift for my Dad.Great offers by Amazon for this Phone. You cant Buy a Super Smartphone Like this at a Price Range of 7500 Rs - 3GB  RAM Variant anywhere in the Online World or at Retail Stores. I love the Fact that Redmi 9A is Far Lighter than Redmi 8a. I ordered the Phone on 2nd November and i Got it on 3rd November. It was not even a Complete day, as there was 2 hrs left for a day to complete. Fastest Delivery by Amazon even for a Standard Delivery Order. I would love to continue my Shopping with Amazon.You can Go for this Phone Blindly.Such a Feasible phone. Love it."
Good deal for the price offered .,4,"  Overall the mobile phone is ok for the price , should have provided fingerprint scanner which is very common now , battery life is good , camera üì∏ is somewhat ok , look is good , very good for normal user , no hesitation in recommending this product ."
its good,4,"  Purchased for my dad, used past 10 days and seems good so far. Look and feel, build, battery life is good. Features are smooth. not played any games and also not done any multi processing so not sure about performance."
Good phone,2,"  good phone for money 7500, 32gb memory, 3gb ram enough is good for normal use, hd display awesome, Played game temple run, Visualation is outstanding, quick response in touch, sound quality average. Camera portrait mode is super. Selfie camera very average.Missing futures infrared remote control, finger print sensor, lighting sensor.overall okay for the budget"
Worth for money,4,"  Writing this review after using this phone for some weeksThis phone is absolute worth for moneyBut iam not a giving a five star rating because iam ana ios lover and generally iam using ios phonesI brought this for my grandfather and by his opinion it's perfectBt i feel a problem that 3gb ram feature is only in it's boxSo if you are a game lover iam not suggesting this for you , but it's perfect for middle agedThe fingerprint sensor is fastBattery life is also goodAmd the camera quality is averge"
"Waste of Money, Worst Processor (MediaTek)",1,"  Battery is good , but mediatek processor is worst , too much hanging and slow processFor Adapter Data Cable is very short arround 1.2 feet , You need Buy One apart from this, it's a extra expense to buy a data cable.Only good thing is no heat producing on charging as well as normal usage , Battery is Superb, arround 1 full day if you are using continuousBetter go Redmi 8A DualSingle star for Redmi 9A, I wasted my money, there is no exchange options for this phone"
Review after 2 day use.,5,"  Camera quality: good image attached from both facing rear and front.Battery life : after full charge work 2 day with all the activities you can doFinger print : doesn't have finger printGlass and display : very crystal clear display but glass is not Corning gorilla.AI Face Lock: working good, some time it's not recognize."
Redmi 9a 3/32 in  not  availableFingerprint  sensor. Battery and camera Qlity Normal.,4,  Fingerprint sensor not available.battery and camera qlity  Normal .I am not proper use after used full review. Why full review not permitted .
Recommended,5,"  A very good item at this price range, bought two pieces for my kids, they loved it, they used it for playing games( Pubg,) they say it run smooth. Big battery..last whole day. Camera, sound and all other features are up to the mark."
Charger kit missing,1,  Need charger kit missing . Complained already raised . Not am issue my mobile .Am already paid temper glass and back cover . This explanation alt submit to customer care . Also my son study online class . Some education app . Already downloaded . So not possible submit to u my mobile . Need only charger kit. By krishnamoorthy .Advice to delivery person .
Nice Buy for parents,5,  I bought 2 GB Ram mobile for my parents. Its working well and surprisingly it looks slim and weight also less compare to other 5000mps battery mobiles. Big display is the game changer here. User friendly OS.For elders they dont need finger scanner . Finally satisficed with the all round impression under the price of 6200/-Average camera can not expect more at this price range at this moment.
Overall a good product in budget.,4,  I liked its processing speed which is very good. The ram is genuinely faster. Camera quality is average. Battery backup in this range is also good. The only problem with this model is that it does lack a good internet speed. I mean whatever sim card you are using this device will not give that much internet speed than what you expect. Sometimes the experience is horrible. The internet speed is very slow in this device whether you use any 4g sim. But what do you expect in this budget. It is a budgeted phone with some limitations.
Budget Friendly,3,"  Purchased this for my Mom. I don't say that this is an awesome mobile but I can tell you that at this price range it's okay to gift this to people for normal usage. Although the camera quality wasn't good at all, I was happy with the ram and storage provided at this price range.Camera Quality: 1/5Processor: 3/5Battery Life: 5/5Worth the money: 4/5"
Not at all happy with the product üòï,1,  I have ordered this Redmi 9A mobile phone as it is reasonable and compatible with my daily use as per the reviews which i got but unfortunately after owning it i have had very bad experience with the battery as it always heats up to the extreme and seems like it can explode any moment..and that too it was for the first time i have connected the charger and was shocked when it got heated up.I request the product approval team to please take a look into this issue with the product.I hope won‚Äôt be disappointed next time.Thank you!
How phone working,4,  Nice phone
- Phone hangs very frequently - Battery life is not reliable if you travel a lot.,3,  Like:- Features which exist in this price range of 6.5K -7K. Makes the phone affordable to many looking out for budget phone with an aim to use for 3 yrs.Dislike: Honest feedback from an educated & wise user.- Phone hangs very frequently (Even when space is enough nd the phone is new like 1 month)- Battery life expires in 24hrs. if you internet is on & talk continuously (I do due to my work). in 12hrs. if you watch too many online videos or listens music.
Value for money,5,  The product is awesome. Looking drop dead eye‚ù§
Nice product within the given price range!,5,"  Redmi 9A (32 GB) is a good mobile phone for those with limited budget. It has got all the nice features and functions. The screen is big, good fingerprint reader, amazing battery life, and a nice camera quality.The phone functions smoothly overall."
Cheap and best,4,"  It is worthable for this price, we can't play pubg and equal to pubg games. For online class this one much enough for the school and college students, it doesn't come with headphone,Camera quality rear is good and the front is OK for online class not for over exposure,It doesn't have finger print, screen size is bigger.I can suggest the people who is trying to buy this product.Seller send me the courier with safe and goodWe can buy it.Enjoy all!"
Best budget phone.,5,  I bought it for 5199 Rs with exchange (samsung J7) . I'm not much into camera or gaming. I bought it for daily use. Best battery life and good camera. Big screen makes watching movie great. Totally good buy for 5199 Rs.
Go for it if you have a tight budget!,4,"  1) Battery life is great!!üëåNo heating problem is found...2) Back camera is good in this price...3) While video recording with front camera i have found little bit hazy, but while taking selfie it is clear, could not understand why this is happening...4) Time taken for full charging from 20% battery life :- 2 hrs with its 10w charger5) Voice recording is very good & clear! Perfect for singers...6) A fingerprint sensor should be provided!‚òπÔ∏è7) Display is also Nice...8) Otherwise satisfied in this price..."
Decent. But worse camera,3,  Overall mob is good. They say it has 32gb storage available but when u get the mobile due to all internal apps u get only 20gb left. Never felt lag Or hang due to multie use of apps. Os quite ok. But worst thing is camera. It's almost same quality as some keypad mobile. And they have done a frod saying it's 13 mp but only 10 mp!!!!!!!!!! with badquality. And photos do not have shot on redmi. Exept camera overall decent mobile
Nice Phone at this price.,5,"  Redmi 9A is a good phone for normal use. The battery life is really encouraging. Battery lasts for almost two days even if Social medias are used. Sound quality is good, Camera is good at its level.Overall a value for money phone."
"Don't Buy,, Useless Camera,, Awesome UI",2,"  Don't Buy,, below avg Camera, for 13 MP, Its not even 2MP camera, Camera has very Low (live FP), MI WAS GOOD BUT NOW MI IS MAKING MONEY, My old MI 6 prime is better than this it has which cost 6000INR,, GO for RealMe C2,  same 13 MP camera for 7000 INR only, is Awesome... Dont Buy MI EVER they are making money now"
Good,3,  No finger print. Just below average phone. It's good for an average use. But its Worth of 7500. Good for online class. I think no other company gives 3gb ram and 32 gb memory with 5000 mah battery and fine camera quality. With 7500 rs
Wow redmi 3rd quality,1,"  This phone is looking good but working bad,very lowest quality phone.If I want search number with any alphabet in contact takes to much time ,all time slow working.So dont buy this phone .Other wise you will  realise after purchae me like because return window has close ,so I have no option.Waste my money."
Not good.,3,"  Direction sensor(magnetometer sensor)not in this phone.You can't get directionality when using maps(you will be always facing one direction.)Apart from this everything is fine for this budget.Not better than Redmi8A dual.I am satisfied with this phone because this is my secondary phone.But for thu guys who are having this as their first,you have better options if using a vouple of hundreds more."
4Star,4,  Redmi9A is really a best phone under this price but when we talk about its camera its third class and you can't buy this phone for photography purpose. Overall phone is good for normal working.
Excellent üëå,5,  My review after using it for 12 daysBest smartphone in this budgetSmartphone is very fast and smooth workingOnly defect is that the camera quality is average but at this price it's perfect
ordered on diwali sale,5,  when ordering your m-phone online you can't review cam. battery health etc.You might be wasting time.That's already available in bulk on YT.You can get detailed review of all there. Talking about order and exp. i've been ordering now since quite a while approx. mpre than 4-5years now.Delivery agent was quite polite this time.packing was excellent.product was up to the mark.every thing was good.Go for it![ amazon ]
Lovely,5,  Good product
Defective display panel,2,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†The dispaly went flickering from the moment I unpacked the phone and booted it. Disappointed and ordered a replacement. Issue didn't resolve even in multiple reeboots or taking MIUI update after first boot."
Not satisfied,2,  I ordered this phone 1 month ago in the flash sale ...that time I got that phone ..& it was written Made in India...But yesterday I received my 2nd phone.it is written Made in China...why is this? I am really confused...& My space button is not working at the time of contact saving.

A great buy for Under 7k.,3,"  ""Battery life"" is great to be honest. i like the display tall, Bright. ""camera quality"" is not match any expectations. Expectations was quite average though for this price point. bloatware always been a hurdle for Mi phones.If You get it under 7K 3gigs ram go for kill.""Game performance"" was good as per the price G25 surprisingly Good processor. Overall a value for money. Ditching Fingerprint not a great option though."
Overall good performance,5,"  The one thing which every Xiaomi mobile is having is its abnormal weight compared to other mobile brand phones of similar features. The camera does not reach up to the expectation but the overall performance of the mobile phone is all ok. It has no fingerprint sensor, thus allows only face and other unlocking systems. An average person can definitely go for it if they dislike Vivo."
Even a one-star rating is more to it.,1,"  Just after 47 days of purchasing it, I got a problem with the phone. It started to reboot in a loop. Then I took it to the servicing center. The problem was resolved. I wish I could end this happily ever after. But, my happiness didn't last long. Hell! it didn't even last for 2 hours. The very next day I went to the servicing center again, the story repeats. SO I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE, as it's a waste of your time, energy, and money."

Overpriced. Go for redmi 9i on Flipkart.,2,  Good battery life but expensive for this price tag as you can get redmi 9i at same price on Flipkart. Both mobiles are same but 9i has 4gb ram & 64gb memory.Go for Redmi 9i on flipkart.3gb ram lags a bit.
Exceptionally cool,5,"  Splendid trendy smart phone, great finish, touch sensors, display in par with more upmarket products.In a budget friendly way, suits basic function, üì∑ is good.Worth the price quoted.Thank you."
Great Mobile with all basic features perfectly matched,5,"  Excellent mobile, bought it for my mother great battery life and nice Camera for the price, My Mother makes phone calls watches YouTube and WhatsApp and she gets nearly 3 days of battery life, she is very happy, small problem is the earpiece sound is a bit low."
Nice phone,5,  Best mobile phone
Device is a pathetic,1,"  The phone quality is best but the performance isn't.The phone gets usually hang within 2 appa running in the background. You can't expect more From this device. I'm using this phone for only Calling purpose for my company sim. I have OP 7 pro for my uses, but this phone is really needs a strong software database, good camera quality, ram performance for smooth use."
Sought of Good Mobile at this price,4,"  The display of the mobile is good enough and battery life is awesome. Camera is you can say OK sought but what to expect in such a low price. A little bit hanging issue due to 2GB RAM , else otherwise everything is good. I got it for Rs.6120 (10% SBI credit Card discount) . You can go for it."

Service center found mother board fault & change it, after that in play store log in itself it turned off again permanently. 2nd service center visit updated the software & it started working. Now if I use it for 2-3 minutes continuously it restarts. Forget about gaming or any smartphone activity."
Not taking update,1,"  Not taking update for Google Chrome and webview system. I called up Amazon customer care, but they did not respond and behavior of customer executive was very wrost"
Average phone- serves its cost,3,"  Average phone, do not expect too much in case of performance. For first time touch pad buyers, if u have already used better configuration u won‚Äôt like it at all. This phone is to give a budgeted gift. Teenagers better put some more money and buy better one.."
Good product,4,  Quality is good in the price range below Rs 7000  battery does not last long and camera captured quality will be ok if you are looking for high quality camera or high battery back up you need to buy higher version model in higher price segment
A unbeatable budget kingü•∞,5,  Got the product today. I am so much happy with the build quality and look of the phone .No other phone have this asthetic look in this price segment.Camera quality also so good.

Average android phone,2,"  Heat problem and less battery backup, hope this will be fixed in android update."
good as a gift,4,  this product is for the people who are in search of average smartphone in an average price range. camera is a little average and it feels a little heavy probably due to its 5000Mah battery and large body but performance is good and there is no heat problem over heavy uses even. This is not for gaming purpose but i played lite games and performance was good. Overall good for general purpose.
Just Average product,3,  Its not an i was expecting. The disappointed me this time. As i come camera of redmi and other with same megepixel i found other much better than it. Battery is good you can use it full day and charger is also fast . But for very normal usage you can bought this product but if you are heavy user dont think about it. It lags sometime.
Excellent Phone at affordable price.,5,  The phone is excellent. Super fast charging. Camera is very decent. Screen is bigger than earlier versions of Redmi phone. Highly recommended.Go for it.üëçüëç
nice,5,  This product from redmi is fine under this price but the display is really bad i think so if you are willing to add some more money üí≤ then go for other product
"Terrible Face Unlock, No Fingerprint sensor",1,  1- Display quality sucks. 720p video seems like 480p.2- Cameras are terrific.3- Too much lags.4- Unstoppable Miui ads.5- Face Unlock usually takes 5-10 seconds and most of the time it doesn't work.6- No Fingerprint sensor.7- Battery is draining more quickly and fast charging is also gone after 5 months.Bottom line- Don't buy this Covid phone.
"Wrong Product, fake promises",1,"  Brought a phone only when it was written  it would be manufactured in India, but when it was delivered we got a made in China product ...... Absolutely fake promise by Amazon ...... When I initiated a replacement request there's no one to acknowledge..... Pathetic service.........!!!!!!!"
Network catching problem,4,  Phone is good. But mobile network catching problem very slowly.you tube not open in my mobile.sir I am very sad.please write down my information
Best phone of rs 6500,5,  I think it is the best phone of rs 6500 no othe company can give us so better product as redmi 9a it is very good phone for lite use but if u are a heavy user then u have to excess your range at 10000Sorry not for pubg or freefire users  but helio p25 is a good prossessor........... It also may not for a camera loveThanks for reading .............................. üôè
Budget smartphone,5,"  One o the budget smartphone in the market1. Long battery life2. Fingerprint reader is nice and smooth3.

According to price it is enough to hold all the features like others smartphone have like battery, camera and others .In my opinion go for it ."
Made in china,1,"  Made in china, build quality bad, speaker also not good...pls go with redmi 9 or redmi 9 prime made in india version"
Good product for the price but could be better if included a back cover & screen guard,4,  Overall good product nominal peformance for daily tasks but not at all suggested for multitasking or gaming or photography coz AF its a budget phone so just fits right with the regular flow. No back cover & screen guard & takes lot of time to charge

Worst ever I seen.,1,"  Camera quality is not good,touch screen behaves unintended input when you make call by close by ear.Flash Light seems low power.Face locking system is not much better as expectation.No Magnetic Sensor, so you can't use compass feature or app.Some of bluetooth headset v5 doesn't works.*** I will suggest better to go for another ****"
Ok phone but as per price & performance its a little high priced,3,  Frequent call drops happen. Good screen etc & camera quality but battery is not that good especially if you have you are connected to data or wifi most times. Most annoying is the call drops & you have to redial & connect.Overall an OK phone which could have been priced lower with the quality it possesses
Don't purchase this.Go for any other phone .,1,"  The processor is extremely slow , even can't process Chrome browser efficiently .Absolute waste of money ,choppy apps.Camera is a disaster with lot of noise and poor light sensing technologyHigh contrast is visible in photos.Poor quality at low light .Don't purchase thisIf you r still here ,that proves u r dumb to think about purchasing this."
Worth buyable under this price.,4,"  Ordered nature green coloured mobile, Amazon delivered in 2 days. Colour is slightly different (dark) than what is visible on site. Battery performance is superb and processor performance is upto the mark. Indoor pics are not good with its camera."

"Third Class, too slow, waste of money phone",1,"  I specially recommended you to don't buy this phone. If you're planning to buy for your old parents or uneducated people meaning they will use only RED & GREEN buttons than you can buy otherwise please avoid buying.Too slow and hanging phone, talking about other features meaning insulted them.PURCHASING A FEATURE PHONE WILL BE GOOD INSTEAD OF IT."

Made in China,2,  The product is made in China and how mi is selling in India after the ban of Chinese phones in India.
worst mobile,1,"  Worst mobile ever, primary function of mobile is calling yet this mobile showing unique problem that on calling fellow person doesnt hear voice at all. as well service centre not able to solve problem. worst camera quality ever."
Good entry level device,4,"  I was looking for an entry level budget phone with latest features, this device serves the purpose, natural green color is awesome.  Beware, the device comes with 'Made in China' label."
Not buy 2gb ram,3,  The built quality is good not great if you are buying this please by the 3gb variant which gives more value of you by GB variant it will lag under 2 months
"Entry level, Value for money,",4,"  Battery life is good after use of intense calls, internet and video lasting for 3 days. Camera quality is good for entry level user. Value for money. So far not use for gaming."
Value for old exchange mobile,5,  Good! as purchased this mobile in exchange offer which is the best in deal. Good battery life. Good picture quality. Overall my experience is 10 out of 10. Thanks amazon for this wonderful exchange offer.
After using one month 9A,4,"  It is fully budget phone for mostly aged people to user smart phone, with low cost and high performance.If you want to use for long term and less use of apps and gaming then go for this 9A which is having good battery backup big screen with 3 GB ram etc."
Below average phone,2,"  It is very slow, lags a lot and hangs occasionally. It gets heated up if you use internet for long. No Gorilla glass, no fingerprint sensor, battery backup is good and camera is ok. Big screen with average display and Sound is a bit low. Dual apps and split screen function is missing. Its a low budget phone from Redmi. Go for better options"
Phone is slow,1,"  I found the phone a bit slow and lags in certain areas. Previously, I was using redmi 7a, 2Gb so I thought this phone might a good upgrade. But disappointed."
"Phone for people who uses Youtube, Whatsapp and for calls.",4,"  The product is decent in the price range. If you use the phone moderately only for calls, youtube or WhatsApp, then this is the best phone. I bought it for my mother and she felt happy, The screen is big and the battery is also good only if you use it moderately. Bought it for 6200 rupees."
Mobail so good and camera quality,5,"  Mobail so good and camera quality osm and battrary is so good, fingerprint one touch finger"
Not a good option,1,  1- Mobile is very slow. Skype app buttons response in 15 seconds.2- Touch of mobile is really bad.3- camera is also very poor.4- this mobiles comes with customised os. Which includes lot of third party apps which makes this mobile slow.5- finger or biomateic is not available.
Nice screen,5,  Battery life is good. I've been using it for 2 months now and it's great. It handles all social media apps very well and the calling audio quality is very good.
Terrible phone. Not even value for money.,1,  There is no magnetometer or gyroscope. Compasses wont work and even google map wont show which direction i am facing accurately. I bought it and regretted my purchase within the hour. No value at all for me. There is a lot of false advertising in other review websites which prompted me to get this.
Worth buy,5,  If you want to purchase a mobile under 6.8k it will be a better one. Giant display at 6.8k. Massive battery backup. Bought the mobile for Rs.6120 in great indian festival.
Slow as snail,2,  The phone is super slow. If one is navigating from one app to another it takes 5-6 second to open.If you open chrome it takes 10 second to open.Camera quality is not good (though the expectations from camera was not much).
9a mobile is good another,5,  Premium look..
Think twice.,3,"  Display and camera quality are too poor, else phone is ok, so it's better to spend few more buck for a better experience. However phone is good for new users."
Good From Xiaomi!,5,  Got this for 6400‚Çπ during the sale and feels like it satisfies the price paid for the device! Good product from Xiaomi! Go for it
POOR QUALITY MOBILE,3,"  I have been using the redmi 9A mobile for 7 months. Atfirst I think it will be good mobile, but now it seemed not good. Its scrolling is not smooth, sometimes it hangs, it shows full network signal but doesn't give net speed and even youtube doesn't continue smoothly. I don't play any online games like freefire or others. Camera isn't good. Only one thing is its battery is good."
WiFi hotspot doesn't connect to Laptop,3,"  Handset is fine for daily usage, video calling, zoom meeting etc. But the biggest drawback is its WiFi hotspot doesn't get connected to Laptop. I had tried several troubleshooting but nothing has worked. Really disappointed with this as I need to work on my laptop with internet on."
Not a Good Handset in,2,"  Not a good handset, its very slow and camera quality is not good. It had purchased it for my dad. Sold it back on olx after 1 month. The only best thing is battery. Charges quickly and runs long"

Not worth for money,1,"  Camera quality is poor, battery life is better. Don't get fooled by the average ratings. Never go for this. Go for some other phones at this rate please read reviews in another site before buying this phone.  Posting the review for third time. Hope this will get posted this time."
Too slow....not worth it...,1,"  Camera quality is not so good, initially I thought phone is nice. However, after using this, m so frustrated and it's too slow. It's a waste of money. Don't buy this. Once again telling, it's very very slow..... please don't refer my previous comment"

Super smartphone for older people (brilliant beginners phone)......,4,"  Decent phone for this price range. But I am not recommend this phone to any youngster who is approaching this phone with an intention to play games. If battery, decent camera (with gcam) are your  main concern then go for it. You can also enjoy other features which normal smartphone offers nowadays."
Worth the price,4,  The handset is good1. Great battery life.2. Display has good pixels.3. Screen is big.4. Ram speed is very fast.5. Camera quality is so so.6. Network hold a lot
Not upto the mark,2,"  It takes nearly 3 hrs to charge fully. And battery draining quickly, though they mention duration hrs as 2 days. Camera quality is ok not that much. And while charging mobile is heat up as I kept in fire.specifications seems to be awesome but disappointed with its working condition. We cannot spend 7k often with these issues."
Best Budget Smartphone at 7499üòç,4,"  If You Want to Buy a budget smart phone then really blindly go for this...With A Good Potrait Camera quality, good processor,3gb ram n of course a large battery backup almost 2 days battery life if you are a normal user. It doesn't have fm radio n gorilla glass protection overall it is a budget smart phone at 7500.Go for this"
Good phone,5,  I tried for 3 GB RAM phone but unfortunately got only the 2 GB one. Memory is the only one constrain noticed.
Long term review,3,  Happy with EMI option as it made the purchase affordable.Thanks Amazon.Product is good value.Would have liked a hard case to be bundled.The Micro USB charging port is cumbersome(User is a Senior Citizen)Would have preferred a non Chinese brand.

Best mobile phone in that price range,4,  Great phone at that price point. Other leading brands do not offer these specs in that price range. Well built and really lightweight phone. Love the color though. Long battery life. Great for kids to attend online classes.
"Value for money,",5,"  Overall good product at this price point, Xiomi claiming made in India product, but we received made in China, I had never thought that I will get made in China product. It's very disappointing for me, Amazon delivering most of product  made in China."

Very bad product,1,  Product is very bad. Mobile is heating up very much and screen colour changes after using it for ten days. Some heat waves comes out from the mobile. First time I received such a bad product from Amazon.
Nice phone.,5,"  The phone has a good battery backup (normal use) and nice design.The camera is okay. One problem that I noticed is that: the system apps use internet even the data is disabled. So, I have disabled the mobile data for all apps to avoid losing balance(since no data pack is active in that SIM)."
Decent Phone for a Decent Price,4,  There will always be Pros and Cons even if you buy a lac phone but for this price it justifies the quality and features fairly
"Long battery life, great functionality and fast",4,"  Good, easy to use, functional phone with good speed and apps. I need to charge only twice a week which is awesome. The camera quality is just average or a bit under but that is not why I bought this phone. Other than the picture/video qlty, everything else is awesome. Great value for money."
Good colour and designed,5,  It's battery life and memory are remarkable. It's a great experience to use a redmi phone in this price. It's really a great product
Worth the price!,4,"  Thank you Amazon for delivering the product superfast. The Redmi 9A mobile is worth the price. Not much expectations from the range yet it functions optimum. Good battery, smooth operation, easy AI response for camera and good processing speed."

I lost my trust in MI.,1,  I lost my trust in MI.I really dilike its quality. Means this phone is hanging since the day i start using it.Toally dissastisfied with it .Waste of money!Waste of efforts!I will never every buy any phone of MI. As it hangs.
Best Phone in 7K price range!,5,"  If you ask for one word to describe Redmi 9A it is 'smooth'. It functions effortlessly with 3GB RAM, and every feature sails without nay trouble. Camera is the only con, but how much can one expect in this price range. Well done, Redmi."
Nice phone in this budget,4,  Battery is very very good and other features is also very good in this price. Only negative thing in this phone is weight
Value for money,2,  Value for money but it goes to hanging mode many times.  Had to update the Android.  After that it started working well but it keeps happening. That is irritating.
Camera is cheap n worst but average  phone is good,3,"  With camera not happy, another brand in this range gives good AVG camera ,but all avg it is working well ,writing this after using this phone for 3 months"
Value for money,4,  Due to 2GB ram and pre installed redmi apps the phone is bit laggy but as per price and brand its good. Go for nature green colour its awesome!
Probably the best we can get in this price range,5,"  Got it for my mom, she uses it for over 8h at a stretch, and still has quite a battery life. Redmi has been improving monstrously. The camera quality is so so, but we don't aim for professional photography with it so doesn't bother, performance wise it's the best in this price range"
overall good experience,3,  what do you expect in this price range?. mi has bundled pretty much everything in it. plus blue is also my favourite color so if you are planning to buy it just go for it. good phone at this price range.
Go For It. üôÉ,4,  Truth about this PhonePros:1. Amazing Battery life.2. Decent Camera.3. Android 10.4. Big Screen.5. Sexy look.6. Low price.7. Dedicated Micro Sim Slot.cons:Nothing as the price rage is low. You can not get everything in this price.

BUDGET PHONE,4,"  Product seems genuine. Battery backup as of 4 days seems excellent.Hassle free performance, except for lagging and heating issue at times. Perfect fit for this budget , especially if you are planning to get it for someone who has never used a smartphone, as it's very much user friendly."
Price should be less,3,  Ok product overall. Camera is not upto the mark. Good display. Average sound quality. Body color is slightly different from shown in the ad. I think price should be below 7k

Best phone for this price segment,5,  This is the only phone for this price segment and a best suggestion my me. The camera quality is decent and not bad at night any how its worth for the money paid. As provoed big display and dot notch are great for this price and I appreciate it. The power back up with 5000mah is good.
Budget friendly phone under 7.5K bracket,5,"  For a Mid tier phone, it packs every feature that you can except for a phone. The phone does not have a fingerprint sensor given the price it is acceptable. Have a good battery life.So far so good."

Don't buy this phone,1,  Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
One of the good choice for low budget phone,4,  If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
Bad camera and made in China,1,  Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
Simply excellent. Read complete review written after my 30 days of experience,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."

Value-For-Money & Recommended for a normal user,4,"  I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
Poor,1,  Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
Dont buy it as lower model is good then this,3,"  Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"

Poor processor basic UI also lagging,3,"  COVID 19 drastically changed everything.

Redme 9A,3,  No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.

Good but not up to the mark,3,  Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
Awesome loved it,5,  It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
Excellent phone,5,"  Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"

Goooooooood,3,  Weary good product  very fast delivery
Points to be noted,3,"  Points to be noted:üëâ The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.üëâ This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.üëâ Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.üëâ Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.üëâ After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
Made in china,2,  Phone is good. But it is made in China
Best phone for PARENTS. 5/5 for Rs.6800,5,"  Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best.

Best in this price range,5,  Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it

Screen resolution is not good & worst camera ever.. rest so so..,2,  Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
Value for money or not?,4,"  So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5‚≠ê for thatPros-‚Ä¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this range‚Ä¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.‚Ä¢Good for basic usage.‚Ä¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:‚Ä¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)‚Ä¢Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"

"Waste of money, Worst customer service.",1,"  I am never going to buy any electronic product from amazon anymore. Experienced worst customer service. Product is not upto the mark. Over heating, network connectivity issue was there. They were using their aaps to dignose in which everything will be showing normal. The same aap can not be used in any other phones for checking. That means this aap is specifically designed by amazone for amazon bought mobiles. You will never know if this is correct or not. Based upon that refund/ replancement will not be done. Amozon update your customer service otherwise if customers make you customers can also break you. After 2 days of continuos chasing no result. Wasted Rs 7498/-."

Not recommended and a cheating,1,"  Amazon is now becomes a cheater, there is no way to return the item..it has below shortcomings..Poor Camera quality, though it has feature for Portrait and Landscape but in landscape mode the clicked pictures are blurred...Poor battery performance, the 5000mAh battery is so poor that it significantly heats up entire phone within  2-5 minutes and drains the battery. Weight is also quite more.I tried to return the item, it says have a test with some software or talk to technical team (after uploading no. of things, very tedious), there are many sites in which you can have hassle free return...You will get frustrated and defiantly could not be able to return the item..there is no way to interact on email and call..so select the items very very carefully..otherwise they are sitting there to cheat your hard earned money...be careful.."

Is anyone else having this issue? Asked for replacement. Let's see what amazon do with this issue!Update: After my complaint, Amazon replaced my phone with a brand new piece. But the same issue happened with it also. So again I complained and I am so thankful to Amazon that they took my phone back and told me that they will refund my money. Phone was taken back, just waiting for my refund now.If you have a Jio sim, just go for it. It is an awesome phone but If you are Airtel or Vi customer then there will be some issue with VoLte and VoWifi."

We buyers must also do our homework before buying a high-tech product.,1,"  I want to share a live (semi-positive) experience with Amazon a week back. I purchased a Redmi 9A phone for my grandson on 21 Dec. The phone came on 24th, but wouldn't boot. I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't bootü•µAnother round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN üò¢üò¢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day‚ùóMoral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier üôè"
China DESH KA PHONE......,3,"  Why do you advertise this phone as DESH KA SMARTPHONE. Did you know, What is the meaning of DESH?. I thought of buying a phone by made in India. But Amazon delivered to me a phone by made in China. Not just the phone, the charger and charging cable are made in China!. If we buy a smartphone at a discount, will you behave substandard manner?"

Video Audio quality.,4,"  Phone is good and battery backup is very nice,working long time. But one thing i faced that i bought on first sale i found one problem that video recording audio not good very low hearing then i returned that one and get change  with new. After getting new one i found that problem is same and that not problem its phone problem. Phone video recording audio is very low compare to others phone. I can't hear clear voice in even low distance recording."
Best for Average usage.,5,"  Overall mobile is good for an average usage. Its camera, audio quality is average to good. Its performance is very good because of good internal storage.Handy as well as the screen is quite wide and provides good viewing angle.Plus point is its battery which is quite huge. Has microusb slot and charger is of 10W thats why charging might be somewhat slow (not that fast)If you want the mobile for an average usage then this can be a best deal for you.I got this 2gb Ram 32gb Rom varient in 6800 Rs.Or if your usage is high i would recommend to go for some other Redmi products for price beyond 8000 to 9000.Below 7000 this product gives satisfactory performance."
Leaves a sour taste,1,"  Pros:1. Performance is Ok, for the price.2. 2 SIM + 1 Micro SD Card Slot, i.e. no hybrid slotsCons:1. Too many advertisements and installs 3rd party apps forcefully. This is not mentioned in the listing. This should be made mandatory. But thankfully practically almost everything can be uninstalled.2. Micro USB port for charging is unacceptable in 20213. Used a MIUI based phone long time ago, somehow I feel it has become much worse and confusing. Even changing your notification sound or ringtone takes some effort and a little bit of scratching your head. They should include a manual LOL."
Very Nice budget phone.,5,"  Ordered Redmi 9A 3GB 32GB version, sky blue for my mother 2 days ago. Delivery was quick. The delivery guy also opened the package on request for assurance. Got the product as ordered.Initial impressions:Pros:Large screen, Nice color, good processor, ample RAM for daily normal user, good battery backup, drains very gradually even if you are on calls whole day. Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions. (Very good in daylight or external use.)One of the best phones available in the market at this price. I have given it 5 star for specifications in this price range. I ordered it with an offer.. More than what you can get from any other Indian brand in 7000 rs."
"Very Fast, Superb Video Calling Clarity",5,"  I was using iPhone 6s Plus and when I got this phone for Rs. 7,500, I was surprised ! It have more display clarity and camera clarity than my iPhone. Also it is as fast as my iPhone. Mi have combined All features of ios and Android in this Phone, that make this phone special compared to other Android Phones. Its OS is Mi modified version of Android. The modified version is very intelligent and smart. It have removed all the disadvantages of Android Phones. It have iPhone features like Face unlock, time lapse video, burst mode and exposure increase and decrese in camera etc.Sound clarity also superb.My Brother in the US have amazed to see the better clarity of video calling than my previos iPhone."

Basic android smartphone,5,"  A basic android smartphone for basic android experience. If you're looking for an entry level smartphone with android os then this is a phone for you.

"Most pathetic product - BE warned - DO NOT BUY !!! Battery, Memory and Bandwidth hogging phone.",1,"  This is the most pathetic product that I have ever had the misfortune to buy on Amazon - and you cannot return the product and hope to exchange it for something else because they do not permit ""RETURNS"" only ""REPLACEMENT""  - WITH THE SAME GODFORESAKEN PHONE!!!!!""It comes preloaded with MIUI and other inefficient memory, bandwidth  and battery draining bloatware and constant advertisements all over the place  - and there is no way you can disable them - by buying this phone you are compromising your data and security and paying for an advertiser to constantly bombard you with adverts for thoroughly useless products -  and you have to pay for the bandwidth he uses up.In an attempt to get rid of MIUI you cannot even flash a custom ROM like LineageOS or some of the other AltROMs cause the manufacturers of the device will not share the code. SO IF YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS DEVICE YOU ARE STUCK.Do not buy - if you happen to have paid for it then your fate is sealed - you cannot hope for a refund ---- better to spend that money on buying some cow dung - might help make a cow happy!"
Nice Phone for doing normal works,3,"  This phone is helpful in basic things, camera quality is not good at all, specially rear camera is not good it is really a 8mp camera but Redmi is saying it 12 or 13 MP...making fool to customers. Overall it is good for taking online classes, making calls, using whatsapp but not for gaming, you can play normal games but if you play games like free fire, it starts heating and lagging. Battery is actually 4800 mAh.."
"Durable phone, worth every single rupee!",5,"  I ordered the phone during amazon 1-month deepawali sale, when it was selling for Rs 6,800. I exchanged my old Redmi phone and got further Rs 3,600 off. Plus I made the purchase using HDFC Bank credit card and got 10% cashback. Net net, i got the phone for Rs 3,150.But buying the phone at a cheap price wasn't the highlight. Its performance has not disappointed me.The features have upgraded and the Redmi-9A offers more bang for the buck. Features are intuitive and easy to use. My contact list was restored in no time.The 13MP camera is really good and, in my opinion, as good as an iPhone. I am exploring the phone's features and it has been a pleasant experience for me.If you are looking to upgrade your phone then PLEASE DON'T LOOK FURTHER!Rajagopalan VBengaluru"
Worth for the money,5,  Worth for the money.. I dont see similar features in other brand for this price range. My parents liked it very much... Wish they added some headphones to this. The color really pop's I was little hesitant while ordering about the color. But it's beautiful üòçüòçüòç
DEFECTIVE PRODUCT RECEIVED,1,"  The bad news was that I received a defective piece (what I feared the most because many customers posted review about defect). The good news was that my refund was processed on the same day as I filed the complaint with picture proof as attached here as well and I received the refund amount within 3 days.Plus, there were these black parallel horizontal lines on the screen, which I just couldn't understand why it was there. The phone looked pretty good (colour and built wise). Maybe would have been a nice one if I hadn't received a defective product."
JUST GO FOR IT.. ü§©,5,"  Amazing phone in such a low price.Great don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick face recognition, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have dual Or tripple cameras because its single camera beats most of the dual and triple camera phones, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick and last thing don't think like its cheap so obviously it will have poor looks and downgraded, no in this phone this isn't the case. Overall I'll give full stars and attaching some samples which have been slightly edited with In built editor.."
Excellent Price!,4,"  I bought this phone in the sale for a ridiculously low price. Firstly if you are someone who uses a lot of apps then this phone is not for you. It is a basic android phone which can be used for photos, WhatsApp and a few others. For the price, one shouldn't expect more. If you load a lot of apps expect the phone to go slow.The build quality was surprisingly excellent and the call quality was also good. Watching videos was also good.Frankly, for this price, I cannot complain about anything.Excellent buy in my opinion."
A good exchange offer,4,"  Pros. 1. This was bought on exchange offer, and I got a good price for my old phone. The exchange was smooth and there were no issues. Was very happy with the transaction.2. I have had it for just two weeks. So I cannot comment on durability, etc. No problem so far. Everything is as described on the Amazon page.3. The phone looks good and I am happy with the purchase.Cons.  Because it was an exchange transaction, the phone was not delivered as fast as for a full cash transaction. I ordered on 25 January and got the phone on 6 February. But I was kept updated about possible delivery dates, etc. So I was not worried.All in all, well worth it."
Good product,4,  The product is good in this price range and as a xiaomi lover you can buy it
Cheap phone with lots of incorrect details,2,  The camera provided in the phone is not  13mp at all.Picture quality is not good and it does not reflect the true colors.its ok that it is a cheap phone but atleast they should mention the correct configuration. If you compare camera picture quality with nokia phones I must say that 2mp camera in nokia made phones have better picture quality that 13mp of this phone. Its OK that this is vewry cheap phone but customer should not think that they will get a 13mp camera. Samsung or nokia make phones with 8mp camera might have better picture quality.rest i can write once i use this phone for a month.
Good and affordable,5,  Very cool phone at this price and camera is average but overall I would recommend choose Redmond over realme
An attractive deal and a reliable phone,4,"  I bought this phone on the amazon prime sale. It was a great deal will a of discounts and I was able to buy it for under ‚Çπ9,000. I've been using this phone for almost a month now and here are my feedbacks.Firstly the good points. Very sleek, good screen size and the menus are user friendly. It has face unlock, pattern and pin unlock as well but no biometric. I can't be asking for more features for this price. 2 sim trays and one SD card tray which is great. I had been using both sim trays form this phone.Now for the bad points. I'm not able to set 2 different ring tones for each sim. So when a call comes in you can only tell by looking at the screen showing on which sim I am getting the call. Next, Screen brightness is not that great. On a bright sunny day, its sometimes not bright enough even if you turn brightness to the highest. Hotspot works fine but you cannot see how many devices are connected. Moreover, you also cannot see which device is connected. Then there are those unwanted, useless Mi apps that comes standard in the phones that send you notifications to upgrade and install even though those apps have not been updated by me.These are the major points. Apart from this, there seems to be no other issues. For a secondary phone this phone is great. Value for money."
Upgraded version of Basic Mobile,2,"  In the name of ""Budget"" phones, quality and features of the mobile is compromised. The camera quality is very poor. Adding to it, the mobile is full of bloatware which reduces the speed of the mobile. Most irritating is ads everywhere - In music, App explorer, Homescreen, in lock mode, wallpaper. You name it and there is an add"
Good quality under budget,4,"  Good product for budget price rangeBut camera quality is average otherwise, value for money  product"
Good,5,"  Happy to buy this good mobile , but little bit specs missing but value for money"
Worst experience,1,  Worst mobile within 10 days we got sound problem. Whatever I am playing no sound at all. After 10 days no return policy.
Dublicate product,1,  One of the Cheapest Chinese product in this category again. It is mentioned as 5000 mah battery in the specification but actually it is not upto the mark. Actually I bought this phone for my father as it has a bigger battery. But it drains automatically within 2 days when there is no usage. But redmi 8A which I am using presently is much better product when compared to this product.I don't know whether XIOMI is prescribing wrong speciation or AMAZON is selling a dublicate product. But my suggestion is don't buy this product even when you have little usage.
9a,5,  ùêçùê¢ùêúùêû
Decent product for its price!,4,"  Best choice for low budget.BATTERY:It is upto use. If you use light apps and its normal function battery last upto 5-6 hours approx.#Using heavy apps(games) definately hange the device and heat it up.CAMERA:Looking at its price camera is decent . Quality is not too good, but can capture your precious moments at a decent quality.WEIGHT:Weight is light easy to handle .Looks nice.VIDEO QUALITY:The experience is not that hd  but gives you a nice experience. Sound quality is also good.It doesn't have fingerprint sensor , there is no back cover."
For the price it is ok..,3,  A good phone for the price.Seems little bit lagging. Back camera good but front camera pathetic. Not good for elderly people because bit bulky.Display is ok. Some of the apps like Google nearby sharing and files go app file sharing is not working.For the price range it is ok..Auto display brightness is crappy..
Overall good phone for daily use but go for 3gb variant.,4,"  Phone is good those who want a decent phone for daily use but first of all turn off all annoying ads they provide. No doubt on built quality, it is solid, durable. Battery life is very good. Camera gets the job done for daily use. I have 2gb variant which I won't recommend for others because I can feel slight lag if 4 apps are in the background, Go for Poco C3 3gb variant as it is the same brand of Mi,also it has better processer n u get 500rs discount on HDFC debit card. I trust Mi for long term use, I never had bad experience. Thumbs up if you find this helpful."
Good in use,4,  Smart use
"Camera poor quality,Hang",1,"  Worst packaging,Camera poor quality,mobile hanging while opening apps in it.Product is little bit ok."
Purchased the 3GB/32GB Nature Green Redmi 9A at Rs. 7499,4,  Purchased the Nature Green colour case on 23 Feb 2021 and was delivered on 25 Feb 2021. I've used it for a good couple of weeks and reviewing this purchase on 09 March 2021.It's value for money. The Camera quality is good and battery life is long as well.Actually I've placed another order for the Sea Blue colour one today.I also purchased mobile case and tempered glass with this purchase. below are the detailsBracevor Hybrid Back Cover Kickstand Case for Xiaomi Mi Redmi 9A and JGD PRODUCTS¬Æ Tempered Glass for Redmi 9A-Edge to Edge Full Screen Coverage.
Pathetic Phone,1,"  Product is below average. This is third Mi phone that I bought and all the three have had network (card) problems. Camera clarity is good but takes 10 sec to launch.. again, poor experience. Battery is good, but compared to other phones in this range, it take double the time to charge... hence the fast charging option too is not at par.Overall A very poor experience with Mi phones. I'll never buy Mi phone in future and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE."
Don't Buy This!!!,3,"  I ordered this phone day after today and it has been delivered to me. I did not like this phone at all because this phone heats up quickly and the sound of the phone speaker is also very low. Therefore, I would suggest that you spend more than 2000 rupees. And buy other smartphones of Realme.But in this MRP it is good"
Fantastic Smartphone .....,5,  Good Smartphone in low budget lover for normal use.I gifted to my wife and she is very happy with phone and it's colors.I received within 4 days.Redmi needs to price 7000 with fingerprint function.Thanks
Good inexpensive phone,3,"  It comes with 2GB of RAM. The Redmi 9A runs Android 10 and is powered by a 5000mAh non-removable battery. The Redmi 9A supports proprietary fast charging. As far as the cameras are concerned, the Redmi 9A on the rear packs a 13-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture.Redmi 9A is not the best choice when choosing an inexpensive smartphone. It got a lot of flaws. On the positive side of Redmi 9A, there are high-quality assembly and materials of use. Also, the screen size is larger, decent battery life"
Good and worth it.,4,"  Got delivered on time. Best budget level phone. Has good outer body design with attractive colour.Specs are good and user interface is smooth and lag free.Cameras are okay, not great. Yes it has a AI mode for better usage.Gets warm while using but no heating issue. Came with 55% battery charge.Overall a good buy in this price range."
Overall good product,3,  Battery quality superb at this rate .long lasting.camera quality is not good as I thought.average camera.display is perfect. Not useable for gamers.aged people can use.overall good phone.kindly press the helpful button
Good mobile at 7k range,4,"  I bought this mobile to use it for calling purpose ,just needed an extra mobile for me. It comes with 3 gb ram and 32 gb hd., Which is suffice to me. Its a good phone for basic necessities like calling, browsing and apps, not a good camera, no fingerprint reader, battery life is good, charging is fast. It's a value for money if you looking at a mobile with 7k range with big screen size and 3 gb ram."
Don't Purchase this product...,1,  Issue started within 10 days of purchase of this product. My phone doesn't charge inspite keeping in charging for 2 hours.Amazon gave us 07 days replacement but the issue started on 10th day. Spoken to the team denied replacement of the product told us to go redmi service gallery for any issue. Now have to keep all my work aside and have to run behind the gallery people to get my phone repaired..Highly disappointed with the services from Amazon ..Worst Worst Product Don't buy people...

My previous phone redmi 7A was much better.Pros:Superb battery lifeBig screen (useful for browsing)Sturdy phone, has fallen a few times, nothing brokeConsDisplay resolution is badCamera is patheticHangs very often , when switching between apps"
Beaware!!!,5,"  In description, mention that the mobile is manufacturing by Rising Stars Mobile india pvt. Ltd., that is India, But see the picture, there mention Made in China.As per my coversation with Amazon as follows:1. Firstly they say...the batch or the lot which you have received possibly it's a old one.Me: how is this possible, after lunch, i purchase this phone on 2nd sale. How it could be old one.2. Amazon: From now onward the same product we are providing to our customers it's ""manufacturing in India"" this information is mentioned on the box itself.Me: what is this means, from now onward...Means previously manufactured in china or actual manufactured in china, there after comes to india and just replace the sticker.How is possible, a product made in India and print on that item other country name.I think they make people to fool and make money, just writing MADE IN INDIA.I request to you also, those are purchased this item please check the truth.And lastly this is possible on mobile/ any other products, those we cheated by amazon."
GOOD BUDGET PHONE,4,"  Redmi 9A is one of the most affordable smartphone by Redmi. It is available in two variants of 2GB + 32GB model priced at Rs. 6,799, while the 3GB + 32GB variant carries a price tag of Rs. 7,499.I Purchased on 23rd Sep.20.l expect it will be good. It is in great  demand. I think it's a good budget  Phone."
Very bad,1,  I hope these reviw help those who want to buy it is not good pohne at all as it hangups a lot for daily usade event the pohne also does not ha a type c which is downgraded. If you want to take these pohne it is bad opt even the delivery services also sucks and very bad service from amazon even i dont want to give single star also
Front camera is very disappointing during nightlights.,3,"  Overall it is a very budget phone.In 6799 it is offering 6.5 inch screen. Screen is good and HD. I don't expect much from this phone as I have gifted it to my wife,so no need of high end multitasking and speed performance but its front camera is very disappointing during night. It shows very blurry pictures in night. The dot dots are very much visible while taking pictures at night, just like a classic phone cameras of 2005 2010. I have used many MI phones ,the cameras was upto the mark,but this time its very disappointing.I was so disappointed with the camera that I ordered replacement but I cancelled it soon for not taking the headache of setting up the phone again. I think it wasn't the single piece defect. There's a degraded quality front camera in redmi 9A. In daytime there's no issue but it is not meant for pictures in nightlights."
Worst,1,  This is hanging a lot and they don't return it ..... Just replace the product worst phone don't go for it
Too Good to Handle in Daily life,5,  thanks Amazon for so good product at best price in the marketphone is very big size screen and 3 GB RAM is totally smooth function to operatecamera is too good and quality is goodall the functions are working properly and the best thing is that it has very nice grip in the back side
Hanging,1,"  Believe the review its hang much.Even in the calling tab when you touch on the search people it takes time.2gb ram what a joke its not even working like 1gb.My old redmi note 3 (2017) works greater than thisThis is so irritating.If you have budget issue, I will suggest you to buy other brand. if you want to buy only redmi then I will suggest you to don't buy any redmi phone that's falls under 10000."
Not much expected,3,  Camera quality is not much expected. Battery backup and screen size is good
Nice Phone in 2300 because i got it in a exchange of my old realme c2,3,"  Nice Phone in 2300 for me in exchange my realme c2Pros to be considered :-Camera -3.5* , nice picture in 13mp don't compare to 48 or 64 at this price i think it's better than my previous phone the photos look naturalDisplay - 4*  ,6.5 inch 720p big and nice display but could have been little brighterProcessor - 3*. The g25 is decent for daily useag but, They could have provided g35 atleast but in day to day nice performance , normal game running without any problem.Battery - 3.5* , battery life is nice can run whole day with normal and some gaming no problem but one issue they said it was 5000mah battery but if you check in any Phone information app on Google Play they show only 4100mah battery so you can check yourselfCons  to be considered:-Now there is no gyroscope or electronic compass in sensors , no or blaster ,no type c , no fingerprint sensor.In 7k i would not recommend this phone redmi 7a is much better deal or realme c3 , but since i got it in a exchange of only 2300 rupees i think it's bang for buck deal for me, but GST are increased to 18% so if you buy any 10000 phone you will pay 1800 or 2k to tex in government so smartphone prices are increased dramatically , that's why they are no longer value for money phone in smartphone market right now.Amazon service is really incredible for exchange, i try to exchange my phone through flipkart but they denied for no reason they have fraud exchange policy. But i have very nice experience with Amazon service , the delivery boy was good too ,Thanks for fantastic service Amazon.Thanks for your time and reading this long review.I will update later"
Super phone...,5,"  Phone looking is very niceBattery back up is very niceIn this price range ,this mobile is goodBut camara is not that much good but okNot coming any case along with mobile,they should have provided case.Over all mobile is very nice..."
Good,5,  Amazing product with this price
Go for it!,5,  The phone is good to give an elder person who does not need a very powerful phone. It's also gotta  large  screen that apt for reading. I say go for it as a budget phone. Gifted it to my mother... She is not the least bit tech savvy. I have not tried any heavy gaming on it so cannot say.The daylight photos are stunning and clear. Have not checked not time pictures.The charger get the phone charged pretty quick.Using it for fifteen days.Go for it!
A downgrade over Redmi 8A. Not worth it.,3,"  When you consider its predecessor the 8A/8A Dual, this one is a major downgrade. A sluggish Helio chipset, Type B charging port, an unnecessarily tall screen, bad camera all combine to deliver a not so VFM product. I am saying this coz I have the 8A Dual as well... Not impressed. With every series, there are too many compromises which is very much unlike Redmi"
Great value for money with low budget,4,  It doesn't comes with fingerprint sensor althought phone has massive battery with decent processors.charging around 2.5 hrs to complete from 0 to 95%. I didn't face any bugs right now. Made of this phone is excellent build quality and big screen added much advantage  it comes with 10w mi charger not supports fast charging.
Value for your money,3,  Value for money....Mediatec processor is bit slower.. dont expect a good cam..Frond cam was good  ...A good phone for older people who did not use much apps...6800 INR
Not so good,3,"  Camera quality is not as per the expectations, with 13 mp you get better camera quality but this phone has bad camera quality pics along with phone volume very less. Average phone i would say for regular use but doesn't justify it's specifications."
Radmi 9A,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
It sucks,1,"  Within 4 months of buying this phone, the storage was full. I didn't get even half of the 32 gb this phone bragged about. And that's all because of the useless pre-installed apps this phone comes with that no one, NO ONE, needs. I can't get rid of those stupid Xiaomi apps. This sucks. Never buying from Xiaomi again."
Good for below average users.,3,  The performance is not as good as specified in the discription. Camera parameters are good but the picture is not as good as it should be with these specifications. Overall it is good for below average users. But don't think of playing games on it as it hangs even on playing simple games like subway surfers. Battery is good and lasts about a day.
JUST A SIMPLE PRODUCT. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH,4,  To be frank it is a good product for the priceYou can't expect too much from it‚Ä¢The camera is ok type but not much features in editing the photos‚Ä¢There too many in built apps but they can be removed if not required‚Ä¢The screen is not bright at all its really dull to see‚Ä¢good delivery by amazon‚Ä¢Only good thing is that you get 3gb with 32 GB storage and a really big screen‚Ä¢It is good for people who don't expect much from their mobiles and use phones for a basic necessity‚Ä¢If you are looking for more features then I do not recommend this you have other options in this price‚Ä¢You also need to buy a cover and screen protector‚Ä¢The box only has the phone with charger and the manual with invoice of bill
Better to not to purchase MI products,1,  I am writing this review after 6 months....After 6 months phone was automatically restart & some time it will go to off mode it may takes 1 or 2 day's to  come back to on mode.... Service center guys saying bord issue but this boar was not available now....

Great Phone at this Budget and Ultra Fast Delivery.,5,"  I really Love Redmi Phones. My First Phone was Redmi 8A. I bought this phone as a Gift for my Dad.Great offers by Amazon for this Phone. You cant Buy a Super Smartphone Like this at a Price Range of 7500 Rs - 3GB  RAM Variant anywhere in the Online World or at Retail Stores. I love the Fact that Redmi 9A is Far Lighter than Redmi 8a. I ordered the Phone on 2nd November and i Got it on 3rd November. It was not even a Complete day, as there was 2 hrs left for a day to complete. Fastest Delivery by Amazon even for a Standard Delivery Order. I would love to continue my Shopping with Amazon.You can Go for this Phone Blindly.Such a Feasible phone. Love it."
Good deal for the price offered .,4,"  Overall the mobile phone is ok for the price , should have provided fingerprint scanner which is very common now , battery life is good , camera üì∏ is somewhat ok , look is good , very good for normal user , no hesitation in recommending this product ."
its good,4,"  Purchased for my dad, used past 10 days and seems good so far. Look and feel, build, battery life is good. Features are smooth. not played any games and also not done any multi processing so not sure about performance."
Good phone,2,"  good phone for money 7500, 32gb memory, 3gb ram enough is good for normal use, hd display awesome, Played game temple run, Visualation is outstanding, quick response in touch, sound quality average.

Worth for money,4,"  Writing this review after using this phone for some weeksThis phone is absolute worth for moneyBut iam not a giving a five star rating because iam ana ios lover and generally iam using ios phonesI brought this for my grandfather and by his opinion it's perfectBt i feel a problem that 3gb ram feature is only in it's boxSo if you are a game lover iam not suggesting this for you , but it's perfect for middle agedThe fingerprint sensor is fastBattery life is also goodAmd the camera quality is averge"
"Waste of Money, Worst Processor (MediaTek)",1,"  Battery is good , but mediatek processor is worst , too much hanging and slow processFor Adapter Data Cable is very short arround 1.2 feet , You need Buy One apart from this, it's a extra expense to buy a data cable.Only good thing is no heat producing on charging as well as normal usage , Battery is Superb, arround 1 full day if you are using continuousBetter go Redmi 8A DualSingle star for Redmi 9A, I wasted my money, there is no exchange options for this phone"

Recommended,5,"  A very good item at this price range, bought two pieces for my kids, they loved it, they used it for playing games( Pubg,) they say it run smooth. Big battery..last whole day. Camera, sound and all other features are up to the mark."
Charger kit missing,1,  Need charger kit missing . Complained already raised . Not am issue my mobile .Am already paid temper glass and back cover . This explanation alt submit to customer care . Also my son study online class . Some education app . Already downloaded . So not possible submit to u my mobile . Need only charger kit. By krishnamoorthy .Advice to delivery person .
Nice Buy for parents,5,  I bought 2 GB Ram mobile for my parents. Its working well and surprisingly it looks slim and weight also less compare to other 5000mps battery mobiles. Big display is the game changer here. User friendly OS.For elders they dont need finger scanner . Finally satisficed with the all round impression under the price of 6200/-Average camera can not expect more at this price range at this moment.
Overall a good product in budget.,4,  I liked its processing speed which is very good. The ram is genuinely faster. Camera quality is average. Battery backup in this range is also good. The only problem with this model is that it does lack a good internet speed. I mean whatever sim card you are using this device will not give that much internet speed than what you expect. Sometimes the experience is horrible. The internet speed is very slow in this device whether you use any 4g sim. But what do you expect in this budget. It is a budgeted phone with some limitations.
Budget Friendly,3,"  Purchased this for my Mom. I don't say that this is an awesome mobile but I can tell you that at this price range it's okay to gift this to people for normal usage. Although the camera quality wasn't good at all, I was happy with the ram and storage provided at this price range.Camera Quality: 1/5Processor: 3/5Battery Life: 5/5Worth the money: 4/5"
Not at all happy with the product üòï,1,  I have ordered this Redmi 9A mobile phone as it is reasonable and compatible with my daily use as per the reviews which i got but unfortunately after owning it i have had very bad experience with the battery as it always heats up to the extreme and seems like it can explode any moment..and that too it was for the first time i have connected the charger and was shocked when it got heated up.I request the product approval team to please take a look into this issue with the product.I hope won‚Äôt be disappointed next time.Thank you!
How phone working,4,  Nice phone
- Phone hangs very frequently - Battery life is not reliable if you travel a lot.,3,  Like:- Features which exist in this price range of 6.5K -7K. Makes the phone affordable to many looking out for budget phone with an aim to use for 3 yrs.Dislike: Honest feedback from an educated & wise user.- Phone hangs very frequently (Even when space is enough nd the phone is new like 1 month)- Battery life expires in 24hrs. if you internet is on & talk continuously (I do due to my work). in 12hrs. if you watch too many online videos or listens music.
Value for money,5,  The product is awesome. Looking drop dead eye‚ù§
Nice product within the given price range!,5,"  Redmi 9A (32 GB) is a good mobile phone for those with limited budget. It has got all the nice features and functions. The screen is big, good fingerprint reader, amazing battery life, and a nice camera quality.The phone functions smoothly overall."
Cheap and best,4,"  It is worthable for this price, we can't play pubg and equal to pubg games. For online class this one much enough for the school and college students, it doesn't come with headphone,Camera quality rear is good and the front is OK for online class not for over exposure,It doesn't have finger print, screen size is bigger.I can suggest the people who is trying to buy this product.Seller send me the courier with safe and goodWe can buy it.Enjoy all!"
Best budget phone.,5,  I bought it for 5199 Rs with exchange (samsung J7) . I'm not much into camera or gaming. I bought it for daily use. Best battery life and good camera. Big screen makes watching movie great. Totally good buy for 5199 Rs.
Go for it if you have a tight budget!,4,"  1) Battery life is great!!üëåNo heating problem is found...2) Back camera is good in this price...3) While video recording with front camera i have found little bit hazy, but while taking selfie it is clear, could not understand why this is happening...4) Time taken for full charging from 20% battery life :- 2 hrs with its 10w charger5) Voice recording is very good & clear! Perfect for singers...6) A fingerprint sensor should be provided!‚òπÔ∏è7) Display is also Nice...8) Otherwise satisfied in this price..."
Decent. But worse camera,3,  Overall mob is good. They say it has 32gb storage available but when u get the mobile due to all internal apps u get only 20gb left. Never felt lag Or hang due to multie use of apps. Os quite ok. But worst thing is camera. It's almost same quality as some keypad mobile. And they have done a frod saying it's 13 mp but only 10 mp!!!!!!!!!! with badquality. And photos do not have shot on redmi. Exept camera overall decent mobile
Nice Phone at this price.,5,"  Redmi 9A is a good phone for normal use. The battery life is really encouraging. Battery lasts for almost two days even if Social medias are used. Sound quality is good, Camera is good at its level.Overall a value for money phone."
"Don't Buy,, Useless Camera,, Awesome UI",2,"  Don't Buy,, below avg Camera, for 13 MP, Its not even 2MP camera, Camera has very Low (live FP), MI WAS GOOD BUT NOW MI IS MAKING MONEY, My old MI 6 prime is better than this it has which cost 6000INR,, GO for RealMe C2,  same 13 MP camera for 7000 INR only, is Awesome... Dont Buy MI EVER they are making money now"
Good,3,  No finger print. Just below average phone. It's good for an average use. But its Worth of 7500. Good for online class. I think no other company gives 3gb ram and 32 gb memory with 5000 mah battery and fine camera quality. With 7500 rs
Wow redmi 3rd quality,1,"  This phone is looking good but working bad,very lowest quality phone.If I want search number with any alphabet in contact takes to much time ,all time slow working.So dont buy this phone .Other wise you will  realise after purchae me like because return window has close ,so I have no option.Waste my money."
Not good.,3,"  Direction sensor(magnetometer sensor)not in this phone.You can't get directionality when using maps(you will be always facing one direction.)Apart from this everything is fine for this budget.Not better than Redmi8A dual.I am satisfied with this phone because this is my secondary phone.But for thu guys who are having this as their first,you have better options if using a vouple of hundreds more."
4Star,4,  Redmi9A is really a best phone under this price but when we talk about its camera its third class and you can't buy this phone for photography purpose. Overall phone is good for normal working.
Excellent üëå,5,  My review after using it for 12 daysBest smartphone in this budgetSmartphone is very fast and smooth workingOnly defect is that the camera quality is average but at this price it's perfect
ordered on diwali sale,5,  when ordering your m-phone online you can't review cam. battery health etc.You might be wasting time.That's already available in bulk on YT.You can get detailed review of all there. Talking about order and exp. i've been ordering now since quite a while approx. mpre than 4-5years now.Delivery agent was quite polite this time.packing was excellent.product was up to the mark.every thing was good.Go for it![ amazon ]
Lovely,5,  Good product
Defective display panel,2,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†The dispaly went flickering from the moment I unpacked the phone and booted it. Disappointed and ordered a replacement. Issue didn't resolve even in multiple reeboots or taking MIUI update after first boot."
Not satisfied,2,  I ordered this phone 1 month ago in the flash sale ...that time I got that phone ..& it was written Made in India...But yesterday I received my 2nd phone.it is written Made in China...why is this? I am really confused...& My space button is not working at the time of contact saving.
Fabulous 1,5,"  Again 1 more redmi 9 series with our family. This time for our mother-in-law. We hope in first sights itself looks like made for her, simple and user friendly phone with all good feature's,,, great to go head,,,"

A great buy for Under 7k.,3,"  ""Battery life"" is great to be honest. i like the display tall, Bright. ""camera quality"" is not match any expectations. Expectations was quite average though for this price point. bloatware always been a hurdle for Mi phones.If You get it under 7K 3gigs ram go for kill.""Game performance"" was good as per the price G25 surprisingly Good processor. Overall a value for money. Ditching Fingerprint not a great option though."
Overall good performance,5,"  The one thing which every Xiaomi mobile is having is its abnormal weight compared to other mobile brand phones of similar features. The camera does not reach up to the expectation but the overall performance of the mobile phone is all ok. It has no fingerprint sensor, thus allows only face and other unlocking systems. An average person can definitely go for it if they dislike Vivo."
Even a one-star rating is more to it.,1,"  Just after 47 days of purchasing it, I got a problem with the phone. It started to reboot in a loop. Then I took it to the servicing center. The problem was resolved. I wish I could end this happily ever after. But, my happiness didn't last long. Hell! it didn't even last for 2 hours. The very next day I went to the servicing center again, the story repeats. SO I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE, as it's a waste of your time, energy, and money."
Phone,5,  The best phone üìûThis phone was good quality and camera and strogeBest priseNice phone üìû
Overpriced. Go for redmi 9i on Flipkart.,2,  Good battery life but expensive for this price tag as you can get redmi 9i at same price on Flipkart. Both mobiles are same but 9i has 4gb ram & 64gb memory.Go for Redmi 9i on flipkart.3gb ram lags a bit.
Exceptionally cool,5,"  Splendid trendy smart phone, great finish, touch sensors, display in par with more upmarket products.In a budget friendly way, suits basic function, üì∑ is good.Worth the price quoted.Thank you."
Great Mobile with all basic features perfectly matched,5,"  Excellent mobile, bought it for my mother great battery life and nice Camera for the price, My Mother makes phone calls watches YouTube and WhatsApp and she gets nearly 3 days of battery life, she is very happy, small problem is the earpiece sound is a bit low."
Nice phone,5,  Best mobile phone
Device is a pathetic,1,"  The phone quality is best but the performance isn't.The phone gets usually hang within 2 appa running in the background. You can't expect more From this device. I'm using this phone for only Calling purpose for my company sim. I have OP 7 pro for my uses, but this phone is really needs a strong software database, good camera quality, ram performance for smooth use."
Sought of Good Mobile at this price,4,"  The display of the mobile is good enough and battery life is awesome. Camera is you can say OK sought but what to expect in such a low price. A little bit hanging issue due to 2GB RAM , else otherwise everything is good. I got it for Rs.6120 (10% SBI credit Card discount) . You can go for it."

It's made in china,1,"  Don't buy this phone , it's made in China"
1 month with you another at service centre,1,"  Worst phone ever bought. After using for nearly 20 days it stopped taking charge. Service center found mother board fault & change it, after that in play store log in itself it turned off again permanently. 2nd service center visit updated the software & it started working. Now if I use it for 2-3 minutes continuously it restarts. Forget about gaming or any smartphone activity."
Not taking update,1,"  Not taking update for Google Chrome and webview system. I called up Amazon customer care, but they did not respond and behavior of customer executive was very wrost"
Average phone- serves its cost,3,"  Average phone, do not expect too much in case of performance. For first time touch pad buyers, if u have already used better configuration u won‚Äôt like it at all. This phone is to give a budgeted gift. Teenagers better put some more money and buy better one.."
Good product,4,  Quality is good in the price range below Rs 7000  battery does not last long and camera captured quality will be ok if you are looking for high quality camera or high battery back up you need to buy higher version model in higher price segment
A unbeatable budget kingü•∞,5,  Got the product today. I am so much happy with the build quality and look of the phone .No other phone have this asthetic look in this price segment.Camera quality also so good. Main attraction about this phone is its display. It's a big gorgeous HD panel in its segment.Considering all things redmi did a great jobWith 9AGO blindly with this product of your budget is 6999
Hangs a lot with a black screen and stops working,1,  Bought two phines and It's been 7 days only and both the phone starts hanging along with a black screen and then needs a restart.‡•§‡•§Worst part is I am not able to avail servicing facility by amazonAlso brand service is ignoring my complaints

You can watch 720p videoPerformance : No lag in day to day useage .Run smoothly every app.***No heating problemOverall product is good and value for money"
Average android phone,2,"  Heat problem and less battery backup, hope this will be fixed in android update."
good as a gift,4,  this product is for the people who are in search of average smartphone in an average price range. camera is a little average and it feels a little heavy probably due to its 5000Mah battery and large body but performance is good and there is no heat problem over heavy uses even. This is not for gaming purpose but i played lite games and performance was good. Overall good for general purpose.
Just Average product,3,  Its not an i was expecting. The disappointed me this time. As i come camera of redmi and other with same megepixel i found other much better than it. Battery is good you can use it full day and charger is also fast . But for very normal usage you can bought this product but if you are heavy user dont think about it. It lags sometime.
Excellent Phone at affordable price.,5,  The phone is excellent. Super fast charging. Camera is very decent. Screen is bigger than earlier versions of Redmi phone. Highly recommended.Go for it.üëçüëç
nice,5,  This product from redmi is fine under this price but the display is really bad i think so if you are willing to add some more money üí≤ then go for other product
"Terrible Face Unlock, No Fingerprint sensor",1,  1- Display quality sucks. 720p video seems like 480p.2- Cameras are terrific.3- Too much lags.4- Unstoppable Miui ads.5- Face Unlock usually takes 5-10 seconds and most of the time it doesn't work.6- No Fingerprint sensor.7- Battery is draining more quickly and fast charging is also gone after 5 months.Bottom line- Don't buy this Covid phone.
"Wrong Product, fake promises",1,"  Brought a phone only when it was written  it would be manufactured in India, but when it was delivered we got a made in China product ...... Absolutely fake promise by Amazon ...... When I initiated a replacement request there's no one to acknowledge..... Pathetic service.........!!!!!!!"
Network catching problem,4,  Phone is good. But mobile network catching problem very slowly.you tube not open in my mobile.sir I am very sad.please write down my information
Best phone of rs 6500,5,  I think it is the best phone of rs 6500 no othe company can give us so better product as redmi 9a it is very good phone for lite use but if u are a heavy user then u have to excess your range at 10000Sorry not for pubg or freefire users  but helio p25 is a good prossessor........... It also may not for a camera loveThanks for reading .............................. üôè

Made in china,1,"  Made in china, build quality bad, speaker also not good...pls go with redmi 9 or redmi 9 prime made in india version"
Good product for the price but could be better if included a back cover & screen guard,4,  Overall good product nominal peformance for daily tasks but not at all suggested for multitasking or gaming or photography coz AF its a budget phone so just fits right with the regular flow. No back cover & screen guard & takes lot of time to charge

Worst ever I seen.,1,"  Camera quality is not good,touch screen behaves unintended input when you make call by close by ear.Flash Light seems low power.Face locking system is not much better as expectation.No Magnetic Sensor, so you can't use compass feature or app.Some of bluetooth headset v5 doesn't works.*** I will suggest better to go for another ****"
Ok phone but as per price & performance its a little high priced,3,  Frequent call drops happen. Good screen etc & camera quality but battery is not that good especially if you have you are connected to data or wifi most times. Most annoying is the call drops & you have to redial & connect.Overall an OK phone which could have been priced lower with the quality it possesses
Don't purchase this.Go for any other phone .,1,"  The processor is extremely slow , even can't process Chrome browser efficiently .Absolute waste of money ,choppy apps.Camera is a disaster with lot of noise and poor light sensing technologyHigh contrast is visible in photos.Poor quality at low light .Don't purchase thisIf you r still here ,that proves u r dumb to think about purchasing this."
Worth buyable under this price.,4,"  Ordered nature green coloured mobile, Amazon delivered in 2 days. Colour is slightly different (dark) than what is visible on site. Battery performance is superb and processor performance is upto the mark. Indoor pics are not good with its camera."
Good budget phone for students studying online @home,5,  Bought this for someone else whose kids needed a phone with good Wi-Fi connectivity for online studies.Working Gr8 for him!Battery life is quite good..
Phone started rebooting not good,2,"  Phone started rebooting n files got corrupted.In 9 days only, I have to take it to service center.Software needs proper handle of corruption"
Crashed and useless after 2 months,1,"  Worst mobile ever, within 2 months it got cashed. Everyone time i open the mobile it displays MiUi and got shut down. There is no option over Amazon to return/replace after 10 days now, where to complain to who should we reach out there is no clue at all."
"Third Class, too slow, waste of money phone",1,"  I specially recommended you to don't buy this phone. If you're planning to buy for your old parents or uneducated people meaning they will use only RED & GREEN buttons than you can buy otherwise please avoid buying.Too slow and hanging phone, talking about other features meaning insulted them.PURCHASING A FEATURE PHONE WILL BE GOOD INSTEAD OF IT."

Made in China,2,  The product is made in China and how mi is selling in India after the ban of Chinese phones in India.
worst mobile,1,"  Worst mobile ever, primary function of mobile is calling yet this mobile showing unique problem that on calling fellow person doesnt hear voice at all. as well service centre not able to solve problem. worst camera quality ever."
Good entry level device,4,"  I was looking for an entry level budget phone with latest features, this device serves the purpose, natural green color is awesome.  Beware, the device comes with 'Made in China' label."
Not buy 2gb ram,3,  The built quality is good not great if you are buying this please by the 3gb variant which gives more value of you by GB variant it will lag under 2 months
"Entry level, Value for money,",4,"  Battery life is good after use of intense calls, internet and video lasting for 3 days. Camera quality is good for entry level user. Value for money. So far not use for gaming."
Value for old exchange mobile,5,  Good! as purchased this mobile in exchange offer which is the best in deal. Good battery life. Good picture quality. Overall my experience is 10 out of 10. Thanks amazon for this wonderful exchange offer.
After using one month 9A,4,"  It is fully budget phone for mostly aged people to user smart phone, with low cost and high performance.If you want to use for long term and less use of apps and gaming then go for this 9A which is having good battery backup big screen with 3 GB ram etc."
Below average phone,2,"  It is very slow, lags a lot and hangs occasionally. It gets heated up if you use internet for long. No Gorilla glass, no fingerprint sensor, battery backup is good and camera is ok. Big screen with average display and Sound is a bit low. Dual apps and split screen function is missing. Its a low budget phone from Redmi. Go for better options"
Phone is slow,1,"  I found the phone a bit slow and lags in certain areas. Previously, I was using redmi 7a, 2Gb so I thought this phone might a good upgrade. But disappointed."
"Phone for people who uses Youtube, Whatsapp and for calls.",4,"  The product is decent in the price range. If you use the phone moderately only for calls, youtube or WhatsApp, then this is the best phone. I bought it for my mother and she felt happy, The screen is big and the battery is also good only if you use it moderately. Bought it for 6200 rupees."
Mobail so good and camera quality,5,"  Mobail so good and camera quality osm and battrary is so good, fingerprint one touch finger"
Not a good option,1,  1- Mobile is very slow. Skype app buttons response in 15 seconds.2- Touch of mobile is really bad.3- camera is also very poor.4- this mobiles comes with customised os. Which includes lot of third party apps which makes this mobile slow.5- finger or biomateic is not available.
Nice screen,5,  Battery life is good. I've been using it for 2 months now and it's great. It handles all social media apps very well and the calling audio quality is very good.
Terrible phone. Not even value for money.,1,  There is no magnetometer or gyroscope. Compasses wont work and even google map wont show which direction i am facing accurately. I bought it and regretted my purchase within the hour. No value at all for me. There is a lot of false advertising in other review websites which prompted me to get this.
Worth buy,5,  If you want to purchase a mobile under 6.8k it will be a better one. Giant display at 6.8k. Massive battery backup. Bought the mobile for Rs.6120 in great indian festival.
Slow as snail,2,  The phone is super slow. If one is navigating from one app to another it takes 5-6 second to open.If you open chrome it takes 10 second to open.Camera quality is not good (though the expectations from camera was not much).
9a mobile is good another,5,  Premium look..
Think twice.,3,"  Display and camera quality are too poor, else phone is ok, so it's better to spend few more buck for a better experience. However phone is good for new users."
Good From Xiaomi!,5,  Got this for 6400‚Çπ during the sale and feels like it satisfies the price paid for the device! Good product from Xiaomi! Go for it
POOR QUALITY MOBILE,3,"  I have been using the redmi 9A mobile for 7 months. Atfirst I think it will be good mobile, but now it seemed not good. Its scrolling is not smooth, sometimes it hangs, it shows full network signal but doesn't give net speed and even youtube doesn't continue smoothly. I don't play any online games like freefire or others. Camera isn't good. Only one thing is its battery is good."
WiFi hotspot doesn't connect to Laptop,3,"  Handset is fine for daily usage, video calling, zoom meeting etc. But the biggest drawback is its WiFi hotspot doesn't get connected to Laptop. I had tried several troubleshooting but nothing has worked. Really disappointed with this as I need to work on my laptop with internet on."
Not a Good Handset in,2,"  Not a good handset, its very slow and camera quality is not good. It had purchased it for my dad. Sold it back on olx after 1 month. The only best thing is battery. Charges quickly and runs long"
Super,5,  Excellent battery back upFingerprint reader goodCamera quality also good in this range especially capturing in low light.Overall good deal.
I claim replacement of device / smart phone as  this product is under warranty period .,1,"  Our product purchased from Amazon is under warranty , manufacturing defect as wel as battery performance.But sorry to report that while charging the battery of this smart phone ,this device has been fully destroyed due to blast of the battery of smart phone .So plz replace this product with a new one as per the warranty."
Not worth for money,1,"  Camera quality is poor, battery life is better. Don't get fooled by the average ratings. Never go for this. Go for some other phones at this rate please read reviews in another site before buying this phone.  Posting the review for third time. Hope this will get posted this time."
Too slow....not worth it...,1,"  Camera quality is not so good, initially I thought phone is nice. However, after using this, m so frustrated and it's too slow. It's a waste of money. Don't buy this. Once again telling, it's very very slow..... please don't refer my previous comment"
Good for Average user's,4,  In the budget it's worth to buy.Worth to spent every penny.Good design and built.üîã Battery backup is fine
Everything is good except camera quality,4,"  I bought this mobile for my mom, she likes it. Everything is good in this mobile like display, sound, battery life, etc except the camera quality. The quality of the camera is same as the quality in button phone. This is not a problem for my mom because she's not a photo freak."

Super smartphone for older people (brilliant beginners phone)......,4,"  Decent phone for this price range. But I am not recommend this phone to any youngster who is approaching this phone with an intention to play games. If battery, decent camera (with gcam) are your  main concern then go for it. You can also enjoy other features which normal smartphone offers nowadays."
Worth the price,4,  The handset is good1. Great battery life.2. Display has good pixels.3. Screen is big.4. Ram speed is very fast.5. Camera quality is so so.6. Network hold a lot
Not upto the mark,2,"  It takes nearly 3 hrs to charge fully. And battery draining quickly, though they mention duration hrs as 2 days. Camera quality is ok not that much. And while charging mobile is heat up as I kept in fire.specifications seems to be awesome but disappointed with its working condition. We cannot spend 7k often with these issues."
Best Budget Smartphone at 7499üòç,4,"  If You Want to Buy a budget smart phone then really blindly go for this...With A Good Potrait Camera quality, good processor,3gb ram n of course a large battery backup almost 2 days battery life if you are a normal user. It doesn't have fm radio n gorilla glass protection overall it is a budget smart phone at 7500.Go for this"
Good phone,5,  I tried for 3 GB RAM phone but unfortunately got only the 2 GB one. Memory is the only one constrain noticed.
Long term review,3,  Happy with EMI option as it made the purchase affordable.Thanks Amazon.Product is good value.Would have liked a hard case to be bundled.The Micro USB charging port is cumbersome(User is a Senior Citizen)Would have preferred a non Chinese brand.
Plz ignore RKLLP seller - Box was not sealed when I received the product. Packing isn‚Äôt also proper.,4,"  Please choose another seller to buy this phone, RKLLP seller first experience too bad.Phone is okay with this price, looks great..."
Best mobile phone in that price range,4,  Great phone at that price point. Other leading brands do not offer these specs in that price range. Well built and really lightweight phone. Love the color though. Long battery life. Great for kids to attend online classes.
"Value for money,",5,"  Overall good product at this price point, Xiomi claiming made in India product, but we received made in China, I had never thought that I will get made in China product. It's very disappointing for me, Amazon delivering most of product  made in China."

Battery problem.Not  switch on the mobile,1,  After 18 days my redmi9A is not working .I am totally disappointed totally waste of money right now what to do I dnt know
Five star,5,  I have been using Redmi smartphone for the last 3 years. This one I bought for my mother. She likes it very much. Redmi never disappoints me.
Good,4,"  The ph is good latest os but no light for notification I had old Redmi model which had it,They have written 10w fast charger in box but I got 5w only."

Worst experience. Amazon please take off this mobile version and don‚Äôt sell this kind of faulty mobile versions . Be aware guys Don‚Äôt buy this and save ur money .
Very bad product,1,  Product is very bad. Mobile is heating up very much and screen colour changes after using it for ten days. Some heat waves comes out from the mobile. First time I received such a bad product from Amazon.
Nice phone.,5,"  The phone has a good battery backup (normal use) and nice design.The camera is okay. One problem that I noticed is that: the system apps use internet even the data is disabled. So, I have disabled the mobile data for all apps to avoid losing balance(since no data pack is active in that SIM)."
Decent Phone for a Decent Price,4,  There will always be Pros and Cons even if you buy a lac phone but for this price it justifies the quality and features fairly
"Long battery life, great functionality and fast",4,"  Good, easy to use, functional phone with good speed and apps. I need to charge only twice a week which is awesome. The camera quality is just average or a bit under but that is not why I bought this phone. Other than the picture/video qlty, everything else is awesome. Great value for money."
Good colour and designed,5,  It's battery life and memory are remarkable. It's a great experience to use a redmi phone in this price. It's really a great product
Worth the price!,4,"  Thank you Amazon for delivering the product superfast. The Redmi 9A mobile is worth the price. Not much expectations from the range yet it functions optimum. Good battery, smooth operation, easy AI response for camera and good processing speed."
Nice,3,"  This phone only for simple usage persons or children, don't expect high performance but best in this price segment"
I lost my trust in MI.,1,  I lost my trust in MI.I really dilike its quality. Means this phone is hanging since the day i start using it.Toally dissastisfied with it .Waste of money!Waste of efforts!I will never every buy any phone of MI. As it hangs.
Best Phone in 7K price range!,5,"  If you ask for one word to describe Redmi 9A it is 'smooth'. It functions effortlessly with 3GB RAM, and every feature sails without nay trouble. Camera is the only con, but how much can one expect in this price range. Well done, Redmi."
Nice phone in this budget,4,  Battery is very very good and other features is also very good in this price. Only negative thing in this phone is weight
Value for money,2,  Value for money but it goes to hanging mode many times.  Had to update the Android.  After that it started working well but it keeps happening. That is irritating.
Camera is cheap n worst but average  phone is good,3,"  With camera not happy, another brand in this range gives good AVG camera ,but all avg it is working well ,writing this after using this phone for 3 months"
Value for money,4,  Due to 2GB ram and pre installed redmi apps the phone is bit laggy but as per price and brand its good. Go for nature green colour its awesome!
Probably the best we can get in this price range,5,"  Got it for my mom, she uses it for over 8h at a stretch, and still has quite a battery life. Redmi has been improving monstrously. The camera quality is so so, but we don't aim for professional photography with it so doesn't bother, performance wise it's the best in this price range"
overall good experience,3,  what do you expect in this price range?. mi has bundled pretty much everything in it. plus blue is also my favourite color so if you are planning to buy it just go for it. good phone at this price range.
Go For It. üôÉ,4,  Truth about this PhonePros:1. Amazing Battery life.2. Decent Camera.3. Android 10.4. Big Screen.5. Sexy look.6. Low price.7. Dedicated Micro Sim Slot.cons:Nothing as the price rage is low. You can not get everything in this price.

Amazing Budget Smart phone,5,"  Based on 10 days of my experience, I have purchased it for my brother i believe this is the best smartphone under Budget with 3GB ram and 6.5"" display & colour makes it more attractive, I recommend it to everyone who wants smartphone under 7500."
BUDGET PHONE,4,"  Product seems genuine. Battery backup as of 4 days seems excellent.Hassle free performance, except for lagging and heating issue at times. Perfect fit for this budget , especially if you are planning to get it for someone who has never used a smartphone, as it's very much user friendly."
Price should be less,3,  Ok product overall. Camera is not upto the mark. Good display. Average sound quality. Body color is slightly different from shown in the ad. I think price should be below 7k
Free Fire,5,  Nice phone so smooth and a nice and enhanced gaming experience.Camara is good in AI qualityNice in this budget
Redme 9a  mobile really a value of money.,5,"  Redme 9a superbbb mobile value of money, 5000mh long lasting battery life, lovely camera, great natural green colour , very stylist design, 2gb ram 32gb storage, lovely smart phone Thank you amazon and redme."

Low budget best mobile but 1 problem,4,  Ossam mobile features in low budgets. All good but YouTube showing 720p maximum and other mobile 360p quality better than 720p qyality on this mobile. But low price main sub kuch expect nehi kar sakte he. Others all good.
Not expected this,1,  I ordered this phone for first time. But 2 gb ram is not sufficient for lagre apps but it can be used for low size apps. Not many apps can be used at a time. Camera is decent.I hate adds which comes whenever we install apps.
Best phone for this price segment,5,  This is the only phone for this price segment and a best suggestion my me. The camera quality is decent and not bad at night any how its worth for the money paid. As provoed big display and dot notch are great for this price and I appreciate it. The power back up with 5000mah is good.
Budget friendly phone under 7.5K bracket,5,"  For a Mid tier phone, it packs every feature that you can except for a phone. The phone does not have a fingerprint sensor given the price it is acceptable. Have a good battery life.So far so good."

Problem not happy,1,  Problem im not happy
Don't buy this phone,1,  Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
One of the good choice for low budget phone,4,  If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
Bad camera and made in China,1,  Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
Simply excellent. Read complete review written after my 30 days of experience,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."

Value-For-Money & Recommended for a normal user,4,"  I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
Poor,1,  Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
Dont buy it as lower model is good then this,3,"  Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
BUDGET WORTHY PHONE,5,  Nice phone.. overall performance is just amazing
Poor processor basic UI also lagging,3,"  COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"

Please..... üôè don't Buy. Cheapest product from MiüëéDon't Believe in Paid Adverstiment,1,"  Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. üòû. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone üì±, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% üòÄ. The phone is too lightweight ‚ò∫Ô∏è and very handyüòÑ Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. üòÉ.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. üò≠GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. üò†üò†.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. üò•. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good üëçBut it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. üò†Display quality is too poor. üò´ Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. ü•∫  No led in front of the display.üò∞Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection üò•If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or aboveü§ó with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."

Winner of the caparison by price is the realme.,3,  REALME batter than redmi now
Value for Money. Well done Redmi.,5,"  1. Display is excellent. Colors and sharpness is good.2. Descent cameras according to price.3. In hand feel of phone is good. It's slim and despite 5000 Mah battery, it feels light.4. Battery backup is good. Easily last one day.5. Performance is good according to price. Mediatek G25 does it job well. You can play COD and FREE FIRE easily at low settings.6. Speaker loudness is average but quality is good.7. MIUI 12 experience is amazing. No ads and reduced bloatware."

nice product,4,  Quite goodBattery and build quality is betterBut camera and speakers are okok.
Over all Ok,4,"  Advantage :3GB+32 For Rs. 7498/-With 6.5 Inch & 5000 mah Battery Acceptable.Disadvantage :*No Finger Print Sensor*Front Camera is 5 MP Only, if it's 8 MP & Rear Side 13+5 MP means little acceptable.Over all Ok."
Redme 9A,3,  No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
Best under budget phone,5,  Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
Smooth and satisfying,5,"  Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
Good but not up to the mark,3,  Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
Awesome loved it,5,  It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
Excellent phone,5,"  Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
Stopüî¥üî¥üî¥,2,  Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
Cons and Pros,3,"  This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ‚ô•Ô∏è no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
Goooooooood,3,  Weary good product  very fast delivery
Points to be noted,3,"  Points to be noted:üëâ The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.üëâ This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.üëâ Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.üëâ Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.üëâ After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
Made in china,2,  Phone is good. But it is made in China
Best phone for PARENTS. 5/5 for Rs.6800,5,"  Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
Best in this price range,5,  Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
Wow,5,  Wow
Very worst,1,"  I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
Good,4,"  Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
Screen resolution is not good & worst camera ever.. rest so so..,2,  Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
Value for money or not?,4,"  So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5‚≠ê for thatPros-‚Ä¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this range‚Ä¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.‚Ä¢Good for basic usage.‚Ä¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:‚Ä¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)‚Ä¢Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"
Average,3,  A little bit slow..I think it will more lagged afterwards..Big screen.Camera is not good.. As well as selfie..Ph is For normal users..
Not up to the mark,1,  Not satisfied. No camera perfection. No finger sensor. Perfect China piece. Cheap and worst. Started hanging.
Nice deal in this price,3,  Pros-A big batteryBig screenGood lookNice processorValue for moneyCons-Poor camera quality both front and backDoesnt charge fastNo finger print sensor
Good entry level phone.however check what ur getting into,4,"  Good entry level phonePros: Big screen, MIUI12, Good batterly last for more than a day with average use,good cameraCons: single rear camera, no Corning glass screen,No radio, plastic back, 10w charger in box- takes long time to charge"

Best phone under 7k no one can compitate,5,  Best phone you can get at this segment totally worth the amount you are paying
Don't buy this product,1,  Do not buy this phone Pretty slow the battery is not powerful Battery is equivalent to 3000 mah battery of other micromax phones.No screenguard/Headphone and case provided The speaker is inferior quality .Lots of eco sound.The processor is pretty slow.The video quality is also not up to mark
Scree size is too much narrow like 5 inch.  Mobille,1,  It's.  Cheating screen size 6.53 but too much narro . You can use only about 5 inch . And company has not write Anny pllace about screenn width size.6.53 is cover is in. Lenth ..So polease do not buy if. You want a big sacree mobile

Best in it's price range,4,"  Mobile looks good and it's worth the price. Cheap and best of its price range. Camera quality is very bad, but in this price we can't expect much. I suggest for basic usage.. one can prefer this product . Like for online classes and other academic purposes."
"Waste of money, Worst customer service.",1,"  I am never going to buy any electronic product from amazon anymore. Experienced worst customer service. Product is not upto the mark. Over heating, network connectivity issue was there. They were using their aaps to dignose in which everything will be showing normal. The same aap can not be used in any other phones for checking. That means this aap is specifically designed by amazone for amazon bought mobiles. You will never know if this is correct or not. Based upon that refund/ replancement will not be done. Amozon update your customer service otherwise if customers make you customers can also break you. After 2 days of continuos chasing no result. Wasted Rs 7498/-."

Not a purchase this product,1,"  Very poor camera Or long time, charging battery I am not satisfied from mi 9a comparison 8a is  a good product so it is a downgrade product"
Good price product,4,  Good product
Not recommended and a cheating,1,"  Amazon is now becomes a cheater, there is no way to return the item..it has below shortcomings..Poor Camera quality, though it has feature for Portrait and Landscape but in landscape mode the clicked pictures are blurred...Poor battery performance, the 5000mAh battery is so poor that it significantly heats up entire phone within  2-5 minutes and drains the battery. Weight is also quite more.I tried to return the item, it says have a test with some software or talk to technical team (after uploading no. of things, very tedious), there are many sites in which you can have hassle free return...You will get frustrated and defiantly could not be able to return the item..there is no way to interact on email and call..so select the items very very carefully..otherwise they are sitting there to cheat your hard earned money...be careful.."

"VoLte, VoWifi Not working!!",1,"  With Airtel Sim, neither VoLte and VoWifi are working in my phone. Airtel Thanks app is showing your handset is 4G but not VoLte compatible. Same thing in Vodafone. Is anyone else having this issue? Asked for replacement. Let's see what amazon do with this issue!Update: After my complaint, Amazon replaced my phone with a brand new piece. But the same issue happened with it also. So again I complained and I am so thankful to Amazon that they took my phone back and told me that they will refund my money. Phone was taken back, just waiting for my refund now.If you have a Jio sim, just go for it. It is an awesome phone but If you are Airtel or Vi customer then there will be some issue with VoLte and VoWifi."

We buyers must also do our homework before buying a high-tech product.,1,"  I want to share a live (semi-positive) experience with Amazon a week back. I purchased a Redmi 9A phone for my grandson on 21 Dec. The phone came on 24th, but wouldn't boot. I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't bootü•µAnother round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN üò¢üò¢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day‚ùóMoral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier üôè"
China DESH KA PHONE......,3,"  Why do you advertise this phone as DESH KA SMARTPHONE. Did you know, What is the meaning of DESH?. I thought of buying a phone by made in India. But Amazon delivered to me a phone by made in China. Not just the phone, the charger and charging cable are made in China!. If we buy a smartphone at a discount, will you behave substandard manner?"

Video Audio quality.,4,"  Phone is good and battery backup is very nice,working long time. But one thing i faced that i bought on first sale i found one problem that video recording audio not good very low hearing then i returned that one and get change  with new. After getting new one i found that problem is same and that not problem its phone problem. Phone video recording audio is very low compare to others phone. I can't hear clear voice in even low distance recording."
Best for Average usage.,5,"  Overall mobile is good for an average usage. Its camera, audio quality is average to good. Its performance is very good because of good internal storage.Handy as well as the screen is quite wide and provides good viewing angle.Plus point is its battery which is quite huge. Has microusb slot and charger is of 10W thats why charging might be somewhat slow (not that fast)If you want the mobile for an average usage then this can be a best deal for you.I got this 2gb Ram 32gb Rom varient in 6800 Rs.Or if your usage is high i would recommend to go for some other Redmi products for price beyond 8000 to 9000.Below 7000 this product gives satisfactory performance."
Leaves a sour taste,1,"  Pros:1. Performance is Ok, for the price.2. 2 SIM + 1 Micro SD Card Slot, i.e. no hybrid slotsCons:1. Too many advertisements and installs 3rd party apps forcefully. This is not mentioned in the listing. This should be made mandatory. But thankfully practically almost everything can be uninstalled.2. Micro USB port for charging is unacceptable in 20213. Used a MIUI based phone long time ago, somehow I feel it has become much worse and confusing. Even changing your notification sound or ringtone takes some effort and a little bit of scratching your head. They should include a manual LOL."
Very Nice budget phone.,5,"  Ordered Redmi 9A 3GB 32GB version, sky blue for my mother 2 days ago. Delivery was quick. The delivery guy also opened the package on request for assurance. Got the product as ordered.Initial impressions:Pros:Large screen, Nice color, good processor, ample RAM for daily normal user, good battery backup, drains very gradually even if you are on calls whole day. Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions. (Very good in daylight or external use.)One of the best phones available in the market at this price. I have given it 5 star for specifications in this price range. I ordered it with an offer.. More than what you can get from any other Indian brand in 7000 rs."
"Very Fast, Superb Video Calling Clarity",5,"  I was using iPhone 6s Plus and when I got this phone for Rs. 7,500, I was surprised ! It have more display clarity and camera clarity than my iPhone. Also it is as fast as my iPhone. Mi have combined All features of ios and Android in this Phone, that make this phone special compared to other Android Phones. Its OS is Mi modified version of Android. The modified version is very intelligent and smart. It have removed all the disadvantages of Android Phones. It have iPhone features like Face unlock, time lapse video, burst mode and exposure increase and decrese in camera etc.Sound clarity also superb.My Brother in the US have amazed to see the better clarity of video calling than my previos iPhone."

Value for money.,5,  Just now received phone. First look great design and display size at this price tag. Speed for normal usage is looks fine. Overall value for money.
Basic android smartphone,5,"  A basic android smartphone for basic android experience. If you're looking for an entry level smartphone with android os then this is a phone for you. This model packs a 3gb ram and 32gb internal storage which is more than sufficient for your daily needs from Facebook to YouTube and anything in between. If you want a basic android experience or just want a phone for your daily driver this one is for you. Do note this ain't optimal for heavy duty gaming. Casual gaming yes, but not heavy duty gaming."

"Most pathetic product - BE warned - DO NOT BUY !!! Battery, Memory and Bandwidth hogging phone.",1,"  This is the most pathetic product that I have ever had the misfortune to buy on Amazon - and you cannot return the product and hope to exchange it for something else because they do not permit ""RETURNS"" only ""REPLACEMENT""  - WITH THE SAME GODFORESAKEN PHONE!!!!!""It comes preloaded with MIUI and other inefficient memory, bandwidth  and battery draining bloatware and constant advertisements all over the place  - and there is no way you can disable them - by buying this phone you are compromising your data and security and paying for an advertiser to constantly bombard you with adverts for thoroughly useless products -  and you have to pay for the bandwidth he uses up.In an attempt to get rid of MIUI you cannot even flash a custom ROM like LineageOS or some of the other AltROMs cause the manufacturers of the device will not share the code. SO IF YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS DEVICE YOU ARE STUCK.Do not buy - if you happen to have paid for it then your fate is sealed - you cannot hope for a refund ---- better to spend that money on buying some cow dung - might help make a cow happy!"
Nice Phone for doing normal works,3,"  This phone is helpful in basic things, camera quality is not good at all, specially rear camera is not good it is really a 8mp camera but Redmi is saying it 12 or 13 MP...making fool to customers. Overall it is good for taking online classes, making calls, using whatsapp but not for gaming, you can play normal games but if you play games like free fire, it starts heating and lagging. Battery is actually 4800 mAh.."
"Durable phone, worth every single rupee!",5,"  I ordered the phone during amazon 1-month deepawali sale, when it was selling for Rs 6,800. I exchanged my old Redmi phone and got further Rs 3,600 off. Plus I made the purchase using HDFC Bank credit card and got 10% cashback. Net net, i got the phone for Rs 3,150.But buying the phone at a cheap price wasn't the highlight. Its performance has not disappointed me.The features have upgraded and the Redmi-9A offers more bang for the buck. Features are intuitive and easy to use. My contact list was restored in no time.The 13MP camera is really good and, in my opinion, as good as an iPhone. I am exploring the phone's features and it has been a pleasant experience for me.If you are looking to upgrade your phone then PLEASE DON'T LOOK FURTHER!Rajagopalan VBengaluru"
Worth for the money,5,  Worth for the money.. I dont see similar features in other brand for this price range. My parents liked it very much... Wish they added some headphones to this. The color really pop's I was little hesitant while ordering about the color. But it's beautiful üòçüòçüòç
DEFECTIVE PRODUCT RECEIVED,1,"  The bad news was that I received a defective piece (what I feared the most because many customers posted review about defect). The good news was that my refund was processed on the same day as I filed the complaint with picture proof as attached here as well and I received the refund amount within 3 days.Plus, there were these black parallel horizontal lines on the screen, which I just couldn't understand why it was there. The phone looked pretty good (colour and built wise). Maybe would have been a nice one if I hadn't received a defective product."
JUST GO FOR IT.. ü§©,5,"  Amazing phone in such a low price.Great don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick face recognition, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have dual Or tripple cameras because its single camera beats most of the dual and triple camera phones, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick and last thing don't think like its cheap so obviously it will have poor looks and downgraded, no in this phone this isn't the case. Overall I'll give full stars and attaching some samples which have been slightly edited with In built editor.."
Excellent Price!,4,"  I bought this phone in the sale for a ridiculously low price. Firstly if you are someone who uses a lot of apps then this phone is not for you. It is a basic android phone which can be used for photos, WhatsApp and a few others. For the price, one shouldn't expect more. If you load a lot of apps expect the phone to go slow.The build quality was surprisingly excellent and the call quality was also good. Watching videos was also good.Frankly, for this price, I cannot complain about anything.Excellent buy in my opinion."
A good exchange offer,4,"  Pros. 1. This was bought on exchange offer, and I got a good price for my old phone. The exchange was smooth and there were no issues. Was very happy with the transaction.2. I have had it for just two weeks. So I cannot comment on durability, etc. No problem so far. Everything is as described on the Amazon page.3. The phone looks good and I am happy with the purchase.Cons.  Because it was an exchange transaction, the phone was not delivered as fast as for a full cash transaction. I ordered on 25 January and got the phone on 6 February. But I was kept updated about possible delivery dates, etc. So I was not worried.All in all, well worth it."
Good product,4,  The product is good in this price range and as a xiaomi lover you can buy it
Cheap phone with lots of incorrect details,2,  The camera provided in the phone is not  13mp at all.Picture quality is not good and it does not reflect the true colors.its ok that it is a cheap phone but atleast they should mention the correct configuration. If you compare camera picture quality with nokia phones I must say that 2mp camera in nokia made phones have better picture quality that 13mp of this phone. Its OK that this is vewry cheap phone but customer should not think that they will get a 13mp camera. Samsung or nokia make phones with 8mp camera might have better picture quality.rest i can write once i use this phone for a month.
Good and affordable,5,  Very cool phone at this price and camera is average but overall I would recommend choose Redmond over realme
An attractive deal and a reliable phone,4,"  I bought this phone on the amazon prime sale. It was a great deal will a of discounts and I was able to buy it for under ‚Çπ9,000. I've been using this phone for almost a month now and here are my feedbacks.Firstly the good points. Very sleek, good screen size and the menus are user friendly. It has face unlock, pattern and pin unlock as well but no biometric. I can't be asking for more features for this price. 2 sim trays and one SD card tray which is great. I had been using both sim trays form this phone.Now for the bad points. I'm not able to set 2 different ring tones for each sim. So when a call comes in you can only tell by looking at the screen showing on which sim I am getting the call. Next, Screen brightness is not that great. On a bright sunny day, its sometimes not bright enough even if you turn brightness to the highest. Hotspot works fine but you cannot see how many devices are connected. Moreover, you also cannot see which device is connected. Then there are those unwanted, useless Mi apps that comes standard in the phones that send you notifications to upgrade and install even though those apps have not been updated by me.These are the major points. Apart from this, there seems to be no other issues. For a secondary phone this phone is great. Value for money."
Upgraded version of Basic Mobile,2,"  In the name of ""Budget"" phones, quality and features of the mobile is compromised. The camera quality is very poor. Adding to it, the mobile is full of bloatware which reduces the speed of the mobile. Most irritating is ads everywhere - In music, App explorer, Homescreen, in lock mode, wallpaper. You name it and there is an add"
Good quality under budget,4,"  Good product for budget price rangeBut camera quality is average otherwise, value for money  product"
Good,5,"  Happy to buy this good mobile , but little bit specs missing but value for money"
Worst experience,1,  Worst mobile within 10 days we got sound problem. Whatever I am playing no sound at all. After 10 days no return policy.
Dublicate product,1,  One of the Cheapest Chinese product in this category again. It is mentioned as 5000 mah battery in the specification but actually it is not upto the mark. Actually I bought this phone for my father as it has a bigger battery. But it drains automatically within 2 days when there is no usage. But redmi 8A which I am using presently is much better product when compared to this product.I don't know whether XIOMI is prescribing wrong speciation or AMAZON is selling a dublicate product. But my suggestion is don't buy this product even when you have little usage.

Decent product for its price!,4,"  Best choice for low budget.BATTERY:It is upto use. If you use light apps and its normal function battery last upto 5-6 hours approx.#Using heavy apps(games) definately hange the device and heat it up.CAMERA:Looking at its price camera is decent . Quality is not too good, but can capture your precious moments at a decent quality.WEIGHT:Weight is light easy to handle .Looks nice.VIDEO QUALITY:The experience is not that hd  but gives you a nice experience. Sound quality is also good.It doesn't have fingerprint sensor , there is no back cover."
For the price it is ok..,3,  A good phone for the price.Seems little bit lagging. Back camera good but front camera pathetic. Not good for elderly people because bit bulky.Display is ok. Some of the apps like Google nearby sharing and files go app file sharing is not working.For the price range it is ok..Auto display brightness is crappy..
Overall good phone for daily use but go for 3gb variant.,4,"  Phone is good those who want a decent phone for daily use but first of all turn off all annoying ads they provide. No doubt on built quality, it is solid, durable. Battery life is very good. Camera gets the job done for daily use. I have 2gb variant which I won't recommend for others because I can feel slight lag if 4 apps are in the background, Go for Poco C3 3gb variant as it is the same brand of Mi,also it has better processer n u get 500rs discount on HDFC debit card. I trust Mi for long term use, I never had bad experience. Thumbs up if you find this helpful."

Purchased the 3GB/32GB Nature Green Redmi 9A at Rs. 7499,4,  Purchased the Nature Green colour case on 23 Feb 2021 and was delivered on 25 Feb 2021. I've used it for a good couple of weeks and reviewing this purchase on 09 March 2021.It's value for money. The Camera quality is good and battery life is long as well.Actually I've placed another order for the Sea Blue colour one today.I also purchased mobile case and tempered glass with this purchase. below are the detailsBracevor Hybrid Back Cover Kickstand Case for Xiaomi Mi Redmi 9A and JGD PRODUCTS¬Æ Tempered Glass for Redmi 9A-Edge to Edge Full Screen Coverage.
Pathetic Phone,1,"  Product is below average. This is third Mi phone that I bought and all the three have had network (card) problems. Camera clarity is good but takes 10 sec to launch.. again, poor experience. Battery is good, but compared to other phones in this range, it take double the time to charge... hence the fast charging option too is not at par.Overall A very poor experience with Mi phones. I'll never buy Mi phone in future and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE."
Don't Buy This!!!,3,"  I ordered this phone day after today and it has been delivered to me. I did not like this phone at all because this phone heats up quickly and the sound of the phone speaker is also very low. Therefore, I would suggest that you spend more than 2000 rupees. And buy other smartphones of Realme.But in this MRP it is good"
Fantastic Smartphone .....,5,  Good Smartphone in low budget lover for normal use.I gifted to my wife and she is very happy with phone and it's colors.I received within 4 days.Redmi needs to price 7000 with fingerprint function.Thanks
Good inexpensive phone,3,"  It comes with 2GB of RAM. The Redmi 9A runs Android 10 and is powered by a 5000mAh non-removable battery. The Redmi 9A supports proprietary fast charging. As far as the cameras are concerned, the Redmi 9A on the rear packs a 13-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture.Redmi 9A is not the best choice when choosing an inexpensive smartphone. It got a lot of flaws. On the positive side of Redmi 9A, there are high-quality assembly and materials of use. Also, the screen size is larger, decent battery life"
Good and worth it.,4,"  Got delivered on time. Best budget level phone. Has good outer body design with attractive colour.Specs are good and user interface is smooth and lag free.Cameras are okay, not great. Yes it has a AI mode for better usage.Gets warm while using but no heating issue. Came with 55% battery charge.Overall a good buy in this price range."

Good mobile at 7k range,4,"  I bought this mobile to use it for calling purpose ,just needed an extra mobile for me. It comes with 3 gb ram and 32 gb hd., Which is suffice to me. Its a good phone for basic necessities like calling, browsing and apps, not a good camera, no fingerprint reader, battery life is good, charging is fast. It's a value for money if you looking at a mobile with 7k range with big screen size and 3 gb ram."
Don't Purchase this product...,1,  Issue started within 10 days of purchase of this product. My phone doesn't charge inspite keeping in charging for 2 hours.Amazon gave us 07 days replacement but the issue started on 10th day. Spoken to the team denied replacement of the product told us to go redmi service gallery for any issue. Now have to keep all my work aside and have to run behind the gallery people to get my phone repaired..Highly disappointed with the services from Amazon ..Worst Worst Product Don't buy people...

Beaware!!!,5,"  In description, mention that the mobile is manufacturing by Rising Stars Mobile india pvt. Ltd., that is India, But see the picture, there mention Made in China.As per my coversation with Amazon as follows:1. Firstly they say...the batch or the lot which you have received possibly it's a old one.Me: how is this possible, after lunch, i purchase this phone on 2nd sale. How it could be old one.2. Amazon: From now onward the same product we are providing to our customers it's ""manufacturing in India"" this information is mentioned on the box itself.Me: what is this means, from now onward...Means previously manufactured in china or actual manufactured in china, there after comes to india and just replace the sticker.How is possible, a product made in India and print on that item other country name.I think they make people to fool and make money, just writing MADE IN INDIA.I request to you also, those are purchased this item please check the truth.And lastly this is possible on mobile/ any other products, those we cheated by amazon."

Front camera is very disappointing during nightlights.,3,"  Overall it is a very budget phone.In 6799 it is offering 6.5 inch screen. Screen is good and HD. I don't expect much from this phone as I have gifted it to my wife,so no need of high end multitasking and speed performance but its front camera is very disappointing during night. It shows very blurry pictures in night. The dot dots are very much visible while taking pictures at night, just like a classic phone cameras of 2005 2010. I have used many MI phones ,the cameras was upto the mark,but this time its very disappointing.I was so disappointed with the camera that I ordered replacement but I cancelled it soon for not taking the headache of setting up the phone again. I think it wasn't the single piece defect. There's a degraded quality front camera in redmi 9A. In daytime there's no issue but it is not meant for pictures in nightlights."
Worst,1,  This is hanging a lot and they don't return it ..... Just replace the product worst phone don't go for it
Too Good to Handle in Daily life,5,  thanks Amazon for so good product at best price in the marketphone is very big size screen and 3 GB RAM is totally smooth function to operatecamera is too good and quality is goodall the functions are working properly and the best thing is that it has very nice grip in the back side
Hanging,1,"  Believe the review its hang much.Even in the calling tab when you touch on the search people it takes time.2gb ram what a joke its not even working like 1gb.My old redmi note 3 (2017) works greater than thisThis is so irritating.If you have budget issue, I will suggest you to buy other brand. if you want to buy only redmi then I will suggest you to don't buy any redmi phone that's falls under 10000."
Not much expected,3,  Camera quality is not much expected. Battery backup and screen size is good
Nice Phone in 2300 because i got it in a exchange of my old realme c2,3,"  Nice Phone in 2300 for me in exchange my realme c2Pros to be considered :-Camera -3.5* , nice picture in 13mp don't compare to 48 or 64 at this price i think it's better than my previous phone the photos look naturalDisplay - 4*  ,6.5 inch 720p big and nice display but could have been little brighterProcessor - 3*. The g25 is decent for daily useag but, They could have provided g35 atleast but in day to day nice performance , normal game running without any problem.Battery - 3.5* , battery life is nice can run whole day with normal and some gaming no problem but one issue they said it was 5000mah battery but if you check in any Phone information app on Google Play they show only 4100mah battery so you can check yourselfCons  to be considered:-Now there is no gyroscope or electronic compass in sensors , no or blaster ,no type c , no fingerprint sensor.In 7k i would not recommend this phone redmi 7a is much better deal or realme c3 , but since i got it in a exchange of only 2300 rupees i think it's bang for buck deal for me, but GST are increased to 18% so if you buy any 10000 phone you will pay 1800 or 2k to tex in government so smartphone prices are increased dramatically , that's why they are no longer value for money phone in smartphone market right now.Amazon service is really incredible for exchange, i try to exchange my phone through flipkart but they denied for no reason they have fraud exchange policy. But i have very nice experience with Amazon service , the delivery boy was good too ,Thanks for fantastic service Amazon.Thanks for your time and reading this long review.I will update later"
Super phone...,5,"  Phone looking is very niceBattery back up is very niceIn this price range ,this mobile is goodBut camara is not that much good but okNot coming any case along with mobile,they should have provided case.Over all mobile is very nice..."
Good,5,  Amazing product with this price
Go for it!,5,  The phone is good to give an elder person who does not need a very powerful phone. It's also gotta  large  screen that apt for reading. I say go for it as a budget phone. Gifted it to my mother... She is not the least bit tech savvy. I have not tried any heavy gaming on it so cannot say.The daylight photos are stunning and clear. Have not checked not time pictures.The charger get the phone charged pretty quick.Using it for fifteen days.Go for it!
A downgrade over Redmi 8A. Not worth it.,3,"  When you consider its predecessor the 8A/8A Dual, this one is a major downgrade. A sluggish Helio chipset, Type B charging port, an unnecessarily tall screen, bad camera all combine to deliver a not so VFM product. I am saying this coz I have the 8A Dual as well... Not impressed. With every series, there are too many compromises which is very much unlike Redmi"
Great value for money with low budget,4,  It doesn't comes with fingerprint sensor althought phone has massive battery with decent processors.charging around 2.5 hrs to complete from 0 to 95%. I didn't face any bugs right now. Made of this phone is excellent build quality and big screen added much advantage  it comes with 10w mi charger not supports fast charging.
Value for your money,3,  Value for money....Mediatec processor is bit slower.. dont expect a good cam..Frond cam was good  ...A good phone for older people who did not use much apps...6800 INR
Not so good,3,"  Camera quality is not as per the expectations, with 13 mp you get better camera quality but this phone has bad camera quality pics along with phone volume very less. Average phone i would say for regular use but doesn't justify it's specifications."
Radmi 9A,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
It sucks,1,"  Within 4 months of buying this phone, the storage was full. I didn't get even half of the 32 gb this phone bragged about. And that's all because of the useless pre-installed apps this phone comes with that no one, NO ONE, needs. I can't get rid of those stupid Xiaomi apps. This sucks. Never buying from Xiaomi again."
Good for below average users.,3,  The performance is not as good as specified in the discription. Camera parameters are good but the picture is not as good as it should be with these specifications. Overall it is good for below average users. But don't think of playing games on it as it hangs even on playing simple games like subway surfers. Battery is good and lasts about a day.
JUST A SIMPLE PRODUCT. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH,4,  To be frank it is a good product for the priceYou can't expect too much from it‚Ä¢The camera is ok type but not much features in editing the photos‚Ä¢There too many in built apps but they can be removed if not required‚Ä¢The screen is not bright at all its really dull to see‚Ä¢good delivery by amazon‚Ä¢Only good thing is that you get 3gb with 32 GB storage and a really big screen‚Ä¢It is good for people who don't expect much from their mobiles and use phones for a basic necessity‚Ä¢If you are looking for more features then I do not recommend this you have other options in this price‚Ä¢You also need to buy a cover and screen protector‚Ä¢The box only has the phone with charger and the manual with invoice of bill
Better to not to purchase MI products,1,  I am writing this review after 6 months....After 6 months phone was automatically restart & some time it will go to off mode it may takes 1 or 2 day's to  come back to on mode.... Service center guys saying bord issue but this boar was not available now....
Worth!,4,"  In this price, this is perfect smartphone for a beginner or senior citizens.**Camera quality is not good as expected. Basic front camera. Rear camera is ok.**No fingerprint scanner, but thank god Face unlock is there.****Good thing is display size and quality.üëç"
Redmi 9A 3GB RAM RS. 7499 AMAZON'S DELIVERY IS SUPERB üëç,2,"  Batteryüîãis ok, camera is worstüëé  you will receive only 20Gb approx to use rest Will be filled with Preinstalled mi apps,Amazon delivery is very fast ‚ö° but mobile quality is not upto the markGiving two ‚≠ê‚≠ê only for Amazon"
Overall good... üòç,5,"  I personally really like this smart phone at this price...  The camera quality is good... As we know the  more camera quality the more price... It is even light weight....By the way I really like it..  I recommend everyone who is finding the smartphone at that price,  he or she should bye.....But about one thing in this phone  I am disappointed,  it is the fingerprint scanner..Over all perfect even I have no words to say.. üòÄüòÖüòç..Value of money....Please click on helpful,  if you found it helpful..  Amazon service well an good .."
Great Phone at this Budget and Ultra Fast Delivery.,5,"  I really Love Redmi Phones. My First Phone was Redmi 8A. I bought this phone as a Gift for my Dad.Great offers by Amazon for this Phone. You cant Buy a Super Smartphone Like this at a Price Range of 7500 Rs - 3GB  RAM Variant anywhere in the Online World or at Retail Stores. I love the Fact that Redmi 9A is Far Lighter than Redmi 8a. I ordered the Phone on 2nd November and i Got it on 3rd November. It was not even a Complete day, as there was 2 hrs left for a day to complete. Fastest Delivery by Amazon even for a Standard Delivery Order. I would love to continue my Shopping with Amazon.You can Go for this Phone Blindly.Such a Feasible phone. Love it."
Good deal for the price offered .,4,"  Overall the mobile phone is ok for the price , should have provided fingerprint scanner which is very common now , battery life is good , camera üì∏ is somewhat ok , look is good , very good for normal user , no hesitation in recommending this product ."
its good,4,"  Purchased for my dad, used past 10 days and seems good so far. Look and feel, build, battery life is good. Features are smooth. not played any games and also not done any multi processing so not sure about performance."
Good phone,2,"  good phone for money 7500, 32gb memory, 3gb ram enough is good for normal use, hd display awesome, Played game temple run, Visualation is outstanding, quick response in touch, sound quality average. Camera portrait mode is super. Selfie camera very average.Missing futures infrared remote control, finger print sensor, lighting sensor.overall okay for the budget"
Worth for money,4,"  Writing this review after using this phone for some weeksThis phone is absolute worth for moneyBut iam not a giving a five star rating because iam ana ios lover and generally iam using ios phonesI brought this for my grandfather and by his opinion it's perfectBt i feel a problem that 3gb ram feature is only in it's boxSo if you are a game lover iam not suggesting this for you , but it's perfect for middle agedThe fingerprint sensor is fastBattery life is also goodAmd the camera quality is averge"
"Waste of Money, Worst Processor (MediaTek)",1,"  Battery is good , but mediatek processor is worst , too much hanging and slow processFor Adapter Data Cable is very short arround 1.2 feet , You need Buy One apart from this, it's a extra expense to buy a data cable.Only good thing is no heat producing on charging as well as normal usage , Battery is Superb, arround 1 full day if you are using continuousBetter go Redmi 8A DualSingle star for Redmi 9A, I wasted my money, there is no exchange options for this phone"
Review after 2 day use.,5,"  Camera quality: good image attached from both facing rear and front.Battery life : after full charge work 2 day with all the activities you can doFinger print : doesn't have finger printGlass and display : very crystal clear display but glass is not Corning gorilla.AI Face Lock: working good, some time it's not recognize."
Redmi 9a 3/32 in  not  availableFingerprint  sensor. Battery and camera Qlity Normal.,4,  Fingerprint sensor not available.battery and camera qlity  Normal .I am not proper use after used full review. Why full review not permitted .
Recommended,5,"  A very good item at this price range, bought two pieces for my kids, they loved it, they used it for playing games( Pubg,) they say it run smooth. Big battery..last whole day. Camera, sound and all other features are up to the mark."
Charger kit missing,1,  Need charger kit missing . Complained already raised . Not am issue my mobile .Am already paid temper glass and back cover . This explanation alt submit to customer care . Also my son study online class . Some education app . Already downloaded . So not possible submit to u my mobile . Need only charger kit. By krishnamoorthy .Advice to delivery person .
Nice Buy for parents,5,  I bought 2 GB Ram mobile for my parents. Its working well and surprisingly it looks slim and weight also less compare to other 5000mps battery mobiles. Big display is the game changer here. User friendly OS.For elders they dont need finger scanner . Finally satisficed with the all round impression under the price of 6200/-Average camera can not expect more at this price range at this moment.
Overall a good product in budget.,4,  I liked its processing speed which is very good. The ram is genuinely faster. Camera quality is average. Battery backup in this range is also good. The only problem with this model is that it does lack a good internet speed. I mean whatever sim card you are using this device will not give that much internet speed than what you expect. Sometimes the experience is horrible. The internet speed is very slow in this device whether you use any 4g sim. But what do you expect in this budget. It is a budgeted phone with some limitations.
Budget Friendly,3,"  Purchased this for my Mom. I don't say that this is an awesome mobile but I can tell you that at this price range it's okay to gift this to people for normal usage. Although the camera quality wasn't good at all, I was happy with the ram and storage provided at this price range.Camera Quality: 1/5Processor: 3/5Battery Life: 5/5Worth the money: 4/5"
Not at all happy with the product üòï,1,  I have ordered this Redmi 9A mobile phone as it is reasonable and compatible with my daily use as per the reviews which i got but unfortunately after owning it i have had very bad experience with the battery as it always heats up to the extreme and seems like it can explode any moment..and that too it was for the first time i have connected the charger and was shocked when it got heated up.I request the product approval team to please take a look into this issue with the product.I hope won‚Äôt be disappointed next time.Thank you!
How phone working,4,  Nice phone
- Phone hangs very frequently - Battery life is not reliable if you travel a lot.,3,  Like:- Features which exist in this price range of 6.5K -7K. Makes the phone affordable to many looking out for budget phone with an aim to use for 3 yrs.Dislike: Honest feedback from an educated & wise user.- Phone hangs very frequently (Even when space is enough nd the phone is new like 1 month)- Battery life expires in 24hrs. if you internet is on & talk continuously (I do due to my work). in 12hrs. if you watch too many online videos or listens music.
Value for money,5,  The product is awesome. Looking drop dead eye‚ù§
Nice product within the given price range!,5,"  Redmi 9A (32 GB) is a good mobile phone for those with limited budget. It has got all the nice features and functions. The screen is big, good fingerprint reader, amazing battery life, and a nice camera quality.The phone functions smoothly overall."
Cheap and best,4,"  It is worthable for this price, we can't play pubg and equal to pubg games. For online class this one much enough for the school and college students, it doesn't come with headphone,Camera quality rear is good and the front is OK for online class not for over exposure,It doesn't have finger print, screen size is bigger.I can suggest the people who is trying to buy this product.Seller send me the courier with safe and goodWe can buy it.Enjoy all!"
Best budget phone.,5,  I bought it for 5199 Rs with exchange (samsung J7) . I'm not much into camera or gaming. I bought it for daily use. Best battery life and good camera. Big screen makes watching movie great. Totally good buy for 5199 Rs.
Go for it if you have a tight budget!,4,"  1) Battery life is great!!üëåNo heating problem is found...2) Back camera is good in this price...3) While video recording with front camera i have found little bit hazy, but while taking selfie it is clear, could not understand why this is happening...4) Time taken for full charging from 20% battery life :- 2 hrs with its 10w charger5) Voice recording is very good & clear! Perfect for singers...6) A fingerprint sensor should be provided!‚òπÔ∏è7) Display is also Nice...8) Otherwise satisfied in this price..."
Decent. But worse camera,3,  Overall mob is good. They say it has 32gb storage available but when u get the mobile due to all internal apps u get only 20gb left. Never felt lag Or hang due to multie use of apps. Os quite ok. But worst thing is camera. It's almost same quality as some keypad mobile. And they have done a frod saying it's 13 mp but only 10 mp!!!!!!!!!! with badquality. And photos do not have shot on redmi. Exept camera overall decent mobile
Nice Phone at this price.,5,"  Redmi 9A is a good phone for normal use. The battery life is really encouraging. Battery lasts for almost two days even if Social medias are used. Sound quality is good, Camera is good at its level.Overall a value for money phone."
"Don't Buy,, Useless Camera,, Awesome UI",2,"  Don't Buy,, below avg Camera, for 13 MP, Its not even 2MP camera, Camera has very Low (live FP), MI WAS GOOD BUT NOW MI IS MAKING MONEY, My old MI 6 prime is better than this it has which cost 6000INR,, GO for RealMe C2,  same 13 MP camera for 7000 INR only, is Awesome... Dont Buy MI EVER they are making money now"
Good,3,  No finger print. Just below average phone. It's good for an average use. But its Worth of 7500. Good for online class. I think no other company gives 3gb ram and 32 gb memory with 5000 mah battery and fine camera quality. With 7500 rs
Wow redmi 3rd quality,1,"  This phone is looking good but working bad,very lowest quality phone.If I want search number with any alphabet in contact takes to much time ,all time slow working.So dont buy this phone .Other wise you will  realise after purchae me like because return window has close ,so I have no option.Waste my money."
Not good.,3,"  Direction sensor(magnetometer sensor)not in this phone.You can't get directionality when using maps(you will be always facing one direction.)Apart from this everything is fine for this budget.Not better than Redmi8A dual.I am satisfied with this phone because this is my secondary phone.But for thu guys who are having this as their first,you have better options if using a vouple of hundreds more."
4Star,4,  Redmi9A is really a best phone under this price but when we talk about its camera its third class and you can't buy this phone for photography purpose. Overall phone is good for normal working.
Excellent üëå,5,  My review after using it for 12 daysBest smartphone in this budgetSmartphone is very fast and smooth workingOnly defect is that the camera quality is average but at this price it's perfect
ordered on diwali sale,5,  when ordering your m-phone online you can't review cam. battery health etc.You might be wasting time.That's already available in bulk on YT.You can get detailed review of all there. Talking about order and exp. i've been ordering now since quite a while approx. mpre than 4-5years now.Delivery agent was quite polite this time.packing was excellent.product was up to the mark.every thing was good.Go for it![ amazon ]
Lovely,5,  Good product
Defective display panel,2,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†The dispaly went flickering from the moment I unpacked the phone and booted it. Disappointed and ordered a replacement. Issue didn't resolve even in multiple reeboots or taking MIUI update after first boot."
Not satisfied,2,  I ordered this phone 1 month ago in the flash sale ...that time I got that phone ..& it was written Made in India...But yesterday I received my 2nd phone.it is written Made in China...why is this? I am really confused...& My space button is not working at the time of contact saving.
Fabulous 1,5,"  Again 1 more redmi 9 series with our family. This time for our mother-in-law. We hope in first sights itself looks like made for her, simple and user friendly phone with all good feature's,,, great to go head,,,"

A great buy for Under 7k.,3,"  ""Battery life"" is great to be honest. i like the display tall, Bright. ""camera quality"" is not match any expectations. Expectations was quite average though for this price point. bloatware always been a hurdle for Mi phones.If You get it under 7K 3gigs ram go for kill.""Game performance"" was good as per the price G25 surprisingly Good processor. Overall a value for money. Ditching Fingerprint not a great option though."
Overall good performance,5,"  The one thing which every Xiaomi mobile is having is its abnormal weight compared to other mobile brand phones of similar features. The camera does not reach up to the expectation but the overall performance of the mobile phone is all ok. It has no fingerprint sensor, thus allows only face and other unlocking systems. An average person can definitely go for it if they dislike Vivo."
Even a one-star rating is more to it.,1,"  Just after 47 days of purchasing it, I got a problem with the phone. It started to reboot in a loop. Then I took it to the servicing center. The problem was resolved. I wish I could end this happily ever after. But, my happiness didn't last long. Hell! it didn't even last for 2 hours. The very next day I went to the servicing center again, the story repeats. SO I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE, as it's a waste of your time, energy, and money."
Phone,5,  The best phone üìûThis phone was good quality and camera and strogeBest priseNice phone üìû
Overpriced. Go for redmi 9i on Flipkart.,2,  Good battery life but expensive for this price tag as you can get redmi 9i at same price on Flipkart. Both mobiles are same but 9i has 4gb ram & 64gb memory.Go for Redmi 9i on flipkart.3gb ram lags a bit.
Exceptionally cool,5,"  Splendid trendy smart phone, great finish, touch sensors, display in par with more upmarket products.In a budget friendly way, suits basic function, üì∑ is good.Worth the price quoted.Thank you."
Great Mobile with all basic features perfectly matched,5,"  Excellent mobile, bought it for my mother great battery life and nice Camera for the price, My Mother makes phone calls watches YouTube and WhatsApp and she gets nearly 3 days of battery life, she is very happy, small problem is the earpiece sound is a bit low."
Nice phone,5,  Best mobile phone
Device is a pathetic,1,"  The phone quality is best but the performance isn't.The phone gets usually hang within 2 appa running in the background. You can't expect more From this device. I'm using this phone for only Calling purpose for my company sim. I have OP 7 pro for my uses, but this phone is really needs a strong software database, good camera quality, ram performance for smooth use."
Sought of Good Mobile at this price,4,"  The display of the mobile is good enough and battery life is awesome. Camera is you can say OK sought but what to expect in such a low price. A little bit hanging issue due to 2GB RAM , else otherwise everything is good. I got it for Rs.6120 (10% SBI credit Card discount) . You can go for it."

Service center found mother board fault & change it, after that in play store log in itself it turned off again permanently. 2nd service center visit updated the software & it started working. Now if I use it for 2-3 minutes continuously it restarts. Forget about gaming or any smartphone activity."
Not taking update,1,"  Not taking update for Google Chrome and webview system. I called up Amazon customer care, but they did not respond and behavior of customer executive was very wrost"
Average phone- serves its cost,3,"  Average phone, do not expect too much in case of performance. For first time touch pad buyers, if u have already used better configuration u won‚Äôt like it at all. This phone is to give a budgeted gift. Teenagers better put some more money and buy better one.."
Good product,4,  Quality is good in the price range below Rs 7000  battery does not last long and camera captured quality will be ok if you are looking for high quality camera or high battery back up you need to buy higher version model in higher price segment
A unbeatable budget kingü•∞,5,  Got the product today. I am so much happy with the build quality and look of the phone .No other phone have this asthetic look in this price segment.Camera quality also so good. Main attraction about this phone is its display. It's a big gorgeous HD panel in its segment.Considering all things redmi did a great jobWith 9AGO blindly with this product of your budget is 6999

You can watch 720p videoPerformance : No lag in day to day useage .Run smoothly every app.***No heating problemOverall product is good and value for money"
Average android phone,2,"  Heat problem and less battery backup, hope this will be fixed in android update."
good as a gift,4,  this product is for the people who are in search of average smartphone in an average price range. camera is a little average and it feels a little heavy probably due to its 5000Mah battery and large body but performance is good and there is no heat problem over heavy uses even. This is not for gaming purpose but i played lite games and performance was good. Overall good for general purpose.
Just Average product,3,  Its not an i was expecting. The disappointed me this time. As i come camera of redmi and other with same megepixel i found other much better than it. Battery is good you can use it full day and charger is also fast . But for very normal usage you can bought this product but if you are heavy user dont think about it. It lags sometime.
Excellent Phone at affordable price.,5,  The phone is excellent. Super fast charging. Camera is very decent. Screen is bigger than earlier versions of Redmi phone. Highly recommended.Go for it.üëçüëç
nice,5,  This product from redmi is fine under this price but the display is really bad i think so if you are willing to add some more money üí≤ then go for other product
"Terrible Face Unlock, No Fingerprint sensor",1,  1- Display quality sucks. 720p video seems like 480p.2- Cameras are terrific.3- Too much lags.4- Unstoppable Miui ads.5- Face Unlock usually takes 5-10 seconds and most of the time it doesn't work.6- No Fingerprint sensor.7- Battery is draining more quickly and fast charging is also gone after 5 months.Bottom line- Don't buy this Covid phone.
"Wrong Product, fake promises",1,"  Brought a phone only when it was written  it would be manufactured in India, but when it was delivered we got a made in China product ...... Absolutely fake promise by Amazon ...... When I initiated a replacement request there's no one to acknowledge..... Pathetic service.........!!!!!!!"
Network catching problem,4,  Phone is good. But mobile network catching problem very slowly.you tube not open in my mobile.sir I am very sad.please write down my information
Best phone of rs 6500,5,  I think it is the best phone of rs 6500 no othe company can give us so better product as redmi 9a it is very good phone for lite use but if u are a heavy user then u have to excess your range at 10000Sorry not for pubg or freefire users  but helio p25 is a good prossessor........... It also may not for a camera loveThanks for reading .............................. üôè
Budget smartphone,5,"  One o the budget smartphone in the market1. Long battery life2. Fingerprint reader is nice and smooth3. Good for old age peole like parents and grand parents because it is economic and also a smartphone as well .4. According to price it is enough to hold all the features like others smartphone have like battery, camera and others .In my opinion go for it ."
Made in china,1,"  Made in china, build quality bad, speaker also not good...pls go with redmi 9 or redmi 9 prime made in india version"
Good product for the price but could be better if included a back cover & screen guard,4,  Overall good product nominal peformance for daily tasks but not at all suggested for multitasking or gaming or photography coz AF its a budget phone so just fits right with the regular flow. No back cover & screen guard & takes lot of time to charge

Worst ever I seen.,1,"  Camera quality is not good,touch screen behaves unintended input when you make call by close by ear.Flash Light seems low power.Face locking system is not much better as expectation.No Magnetic Sensor, so you can't use compass feature or app.Some of bluetooth headset v5 doesn't works.*** I will suggest better to go for another ****"
Ok phone but as per price & performance its a little high priced,3,  Frequent call drops happen. Good screen etc & camera quality but battery is not that good especially if you have you are connected to data or wifi most times. Most annoying is the call drops & you have to redial & connect.Overall an OK phone which could have been priced lower with the quality it possesses
Don't purchase this.Go for any other phone .,1,"  The processor is extremely slow , even can't process Chrome browser efficiently .Absolute waste of money ,choppy apps.Camera is a disaster with lot of noise and poor light sensing technologyHigh contrast is visible in photos.Poor quality at low light .Don't purchase thisIf you r still here ,that proves u r dumb to think about purchasing this."
Worth buyable under this price.,4,"  Ordered nature green coloured mobile, Amazon delivered in 2 days. Colour is slightly different (dark) than what is visible on site. Battery performance is superb and processor performance is upto the mark. Indoor pics are not good with its camera."

"Third Class, too slow, waste of money phone",1,"  I specially recommended you to don't buy this phone. If you're planning to buy for your old parents or uneducated people meaning they will use only RED & GREEN buttons than you can buy otherwise please avoid buying.Too slow and hanging phone, talking about other features meaning insulted them.PURCHASING A FEATURE PHONE WILL BE GOOD INSTEAD OF IT."

Made in China,2,  The product is made in China and how mi is selling in India after the ban of Chinese phones in India.
worst mobile,1,"  Worst mobile ever, primary function of mobile is calling yet this mobile showing unique problem that on calling fellow person doesnt hear voice at all. as well service centre not able to solve problem. worst camera quality ever."
Good entry level device,4,"  I was looking for an entry level budget phone with latest features, this device serves the purpose, natural green color is awesome.  Beware, the device comes with 'Made in China' label."
Not buy 2gb ram,3,  The built quality is good not great if you are buying this please by the 3gb variant which gives more value of you by GB variant it will lag under 2 months
"Entry level, Value for money,",4,"  Battery life is good after use of intense calls, internet and video lasting for 3 days. Camera quality is good for entry level user. Value for money. So far not use for gaming."
Value for old exchange mobile,5,  Good! as purchased this mobile in exchange offer which is the best in deal. Good battery life. Good picture quality. Overall my experience is 10 out of 10. Thanks amazon for this wonderful exchange offer.
After using one month 9A,4,"  It is fully budget phone for mostly aged people to user smart phone, with low cost and high performance.If you want to use for long term and less use of apps and gaming then go for this 9A which is having good battery backup big screen with 3 GB ram etc."
Below average phone,2,"  It is very slow, lags a lot and hangs occasionally. It gets heated up if you use internet for long. No Gorilla glass, no fingerprint sensor, battery backup is good and camera is ok. Big screen with average display and Sound is a bit low. Dual apps and split screen function is missing. Its a low budget phone from Redmi. Go for better options"
Phone is slow,1,"  I found the phone a bit slow and lags in certain areas. Previously, I was using redmi 7a, 2Gb so I thought this phone might a good upgrade. But disappointed."
"Phone for people who uses Youtube, Whatsapp and for calls.",4,"  The product is decent in the price range. If you use the phone moderately only for calls, youtube or WhatsApp, then this is the best phone. I bought it for my mother and she felt happy, The screen is big and the battery is also good only if you use it moderately. Bought it for 6200 rupees."
Mobail so good and camera quality,5,"  Mobail so good and camera quality osm and battrary is so good, fingerprint one touch finger"
Not a good option,1,  1- Mobile is very slow. Skype app buttons response in 15 seconds.2- Touch of mobile is really bad.3- camera is also very poor.4- this mobiles comes with customised os. Which includes lot of third party apps which makes this mobile slow.5- finger or biomateic is not available.
Nice screen,5,  Battery life is good. I've been using it for 2 months now and it's great. It handles all social media apps very well and the calling audio quality is very good.
Terrible phone. Not even value for money.,1,  There is no magnetometer or gyroscope. Compasses wont work and even google map wont show which direction i am facing accurately. I bought it and regretted my purchase within the hour. No value at all for me. There is a lot of false advertising in other review websites which prompted me to get this.
Worth buy,5,  If you want to purchase a mobile under 6.8k it will be a better one. Giant display at 6.8k. Massive battery backup. Bought the mobile for Rs.6120 in great indian festival.
Slow as snail,2,  The phone is super slow. If one is navigating from one app to another it takes 5-6 second to open.If you open chrome it takes 10 second to open.Camera quality is not good (though the expectations from camera was not much).
9a mobile is good another,5,  Premium look..
Think twice.,3,"  Display and camera quality are too poor, else phone is ok, so it's better to spend few more buck for a better experience. However phone is good for new users."
Good From Xiaomi!,5,  Got this for 6400‚Çπ during the sale and feels like it satisfies the price paid for the device! Good product from Xiaomi! Go for it
POOR QUALITY MOBILE,3,"  I have been using the redmi 9A mobile for 7 months. Atfirst I think it will be good mobile, but now it seemed not good. Its scrolling is not smooth, sometimes it hangs, it shows full network signal but doesn't give net speed and even youtube doesn't continue smoothly. I don't play any online games like freefire or others. Camera isn't good. Only one thing is its battery is good."
WiFi hotspot doesn't connect to Laptop,3,"  Handset is fine for daily usage, video calling, zoom meeting etc. But the biggest drawback is its WiFi hotspot doesn't get connected to Laptop. I had tried several troubleshooting but nothing has worked. Really disappointed with this as I need to work on my laptop with internet on."
Not a Good Handset in,2,"  Not a good handset, its very slow and camera quality is not good. It had purchased it for my dad. Sold it back on olx after 1 month. The only best thing is battery. Charges quickly and runs long"

Not worth for money,1,"  Camera quality is poor, battery life is better. Don't get fooled by the average ratings. Never go for this. Go for some other phones at this rate please read reviews in another site before buying this phone.  Posting the review for third time. Hope this will get posted this time."
Too slow....not worth it...,1,"  Camera quality is not so good, initially I thought phone is nice. However, after using this, m so frustrated and it's too slow. It's a waste of money. Don't buy this. Once again telling, it's very very slow..... please don't refer my previous comment"

Super smartphone for older people (brilliant beginners phone)......,4,"  Decent phone for this price range. But I am not recommend this phone to any youngster who is approaching this phone with an intention to play games. If battery, decent camera (with gcam) are your  main concern then go for it.

Worth the price,4,  The handset is good1. Great battery life.2. Display has good pixels.3. Screen is big.4. Ram speed is very fast.5. Camera quality is so so.6. Network hold a lot
Not upto the mark,2,"  It takes nearly 3 hrs to charge fully. And battery draining quickly, though they mention duration hrs as 2 days. Camera quality is ok not that much.

It doesn't have fm radio n gorilla glass protection overall it is a budget smart phone at 7500.Go for this"
Good phone,5,  I tried for 3 GB RAM phone but unfortunately got only the 2 GB one. Memory is the only one constrain noticed.
Long term review,3,  Happy with EMI option as it made the purchase affordable.Thanks Amazon.Product is good value.Would have liked a hard case to be bundled.The Micro USB charging port is cumbersome(User is a Senior Citizen)Would have preferred a non Chinese brand.

Best mobile phone in that price range,4,  Great phone at that price point. Other leading brands do not offer these specs in that price range. Well built and really lightweight phone. Love the color though. Long battery life. Great for kids to attend online classes.
"Value for money,",5,"  Overall good product at this price point, Xiomi claiming made in India product, but we received made in China, I had never thought that I will get made in China product. It's very disappointing for me, Amazon delivering most of product  made in China."

Very bad product,1,  Product is very bad. Mobile is heating up very much and screen colour changes after using it for ten days. Some heat waves comes out from the mobile. First time I received such a bad product from Amazon.
Nice phone.,5,"  The phone has a good battery backup (normal use) and nice design.The camera is okay. One problem that I noticed is that: the system apps use internet even the data is disabled. So, I have disabled the mobile data for all apps to avoid losing balance(since no data pack is active in that SIM)."
Decent Phone for a Decent Price,4,  There will always be Pros and Cons even if you buy a lac phone but for this price it justifies the quality and features fairly
"Long battery life, great functionality and fast",4,"  Good, easy to use, functional phone with good speed and apps. I need to charge only twice a week which is awesome. The camera quality is just average or a bit under but that is not why I bought this phone. Other than the picture/video qlty, everything else is awesome. Great value for money."
Good colour and designed,5,  It's battery life and memory are remarkable. It's a great experience to use a redmi phone in this price. It's really a great product
Worth the price!,4,"  Thank you Amazon for delivering the product superfast. The Redmi 9A mobile is worth the price. Not much expectations from the range yet it functions optimum. Good battery, smooth operation, easy AI response for camera and good processing speed."
Nice,3,"  This phone only for simple usage persons or children, don't expect high performance but best in this price segment"
I lost my trust in MI.,1,  I lost my trust in MI.I really dilike its quality. Means this phone is hanging since the day i start using it.Toally dissastisfied with it .Waste of money!Waste of efforts!I will never every buy any phone of MI. As it hangs.
Best Phone in 7K price range!,5,"  If you ask for one word to describe Redmi 9A it is 'smooth'. It functions effortlessly with 3GB RAM, and every feature sails without nay trouble. Camera is the only con, but how much can one expect in this price range. Well done, Redmi."
Nice phone in this budget,4,  Battery is very very good and other features is also very good in this price. Only negative thing in this phone is weight
Value for money,2,  Value for money but it goes to hanging mode many times.  Had to update the Android.  After that it started working well but it keeps happening. That is irritating.
Camera is cheap n worst but average  phone is good,3,"  With camera not happy, another brand in this range gives good AVG camera ,but all avg it is working well ,writing this after using this phone for 3 months"
Value for money,4,  Due to 2GB ram and pre installed redmi apps the phone is bit laggy but as per price and brand its good. Go for nature green colour its awesome!
Probably the best we can get in this price range,5,"  Got it for my mom, she uses it for over 8h at a stretch, and still has quite a battery life. Redmi has been improving monstrously. The camera quality is so so, but we don't aim for professional photography with it so doesn't bother, performance wise it's the best in this price range"
overall good experience,3,  what do you expect in this price range?. mi has bundled pretty much everything in it. plus blue is also my favourite color so if you are planning to buy it just go for it. good phone at this price range.
Go For It. üôÉ,4,  Truth about this PhonePros:1. Amazing Battery life.2. Decent Camera.3. Android 10.4. Big Screen.5. Sexy look.6. Low price.7. Dedicated Micro Sim Slot.cons:Nothing as the price rage is low. You can not get everything in this price.

Amazing Budget Smart phone,5,"  Based on 10 days of my experience, I have purchased it for my brother i believe this is the best smartphone under Budget with 3GB ram and 6.5"" display & colour makes it more attractive, I recommend it to everyone who wants smartphone under 7500."
BUDGET PHONE,4,"  Product seems genuine. Battery backup as of 4 days seems excellent.Hassle free performance, except for lagging and heating issue at times. Perfect fit for this budget , especially if you are planning to get it for someone who has never used a smartphone, as it's very much user friendly."
Price should be less,3,  Ok product overall. Camera is not upto the mark. Good display. Average sound quality. Body color is slightly different from shown in the ad. I think price should be below 7k

Not expected this,1,  I ordered this phone for first time. But 2 gb ram is not sufficient for lagre apps but it can be used for low size apps. Not many apps can be used at a time. Camera is decent.I hate adds which comes whenever we install apps.
Best phone for this price segment,5,  This is the only phone for this price segment and a best suggestion my me. The camera quality is decent and not bad at night any how its worth for the money paid. As provoed big display and dot notch are great for this price and I appreciate it. The power back up with 5000mah is good.
Budget friendly phone under 7.5K bracket,5,"  For a Mid tier phone, it packs every feature that you can except for a phone. The phone does not have a fingerprint sensor given the price it is acceptable. Have a good battery life.So far so good."

"Not satisfied, camera quality is not upto the mark as compared to 5A, 8A",2,"  I bought the redmi 9A without cover and screen guard, the same earlier I bought from redmi store I received both with the mobile, that is lacking with the product. Performance is good audio, camera is not upto the mark. 8A is better than this 9A. Not satisfiedüòäüòÜ."
Nice phone,5,  Redmi is reputed brand with economic price so worth to buy this phone. This phone is perfect for my child for online study. all working good. thanks to amazon.
Mobile processor slow,3,  Mobile overlay ok not good. Network capacity is poor .frequently net disconnect. Mediatek helio processor is not good than snapdragon.
Pathetic service,1,"  Amazon promised to replace it as it had error which their technician approved too, but no-one really cared to replace it even after a month and several requests. I am going to think thrice before ordering expensive stuff from here."
"Issue with the charger, rest everything is awesome.",4,  The phone is very nice in condition but it seems like the charger that I received is not of this phone as it is disconnecting again and again and that is why I'm unable to charge my phone. Today also the phone was connected to the charger for a long time still it did not charge.
This phone is goodüëçunder this price 7.5k....,4,  Nice color and style as of now working fine no hang or sound loud but charger is slow.Network connectivity is also strong .......and camera quality is not good but it's ok at this affordable price....Go for it if you have budget of under 8k.
Performance is very very slow,1,  Not expected quality don‚Äôt buy it go for Nokia it‚Äôs better.Also wood like to say about Amazone service: after buy phone very bed service experience from Amazone also
It doesn't get better than this at this price!,4,"  Pretty decent phone for the price.. Being Redmi, it'll probably become slow in a year.. Bought this for a colleague.. Being a light user, it is perfect for him to use whatsapp, facebook and some web browsing.."

Problem not happy,1,  Problem im not happy
Don't buy this phone,1,  Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
One of the good choice for low budget phone,4,  If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
Bad camera and made in China,1,  Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
Simply excellent. Read complete review written after my 30 days of experience,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
Amezing One,5,"  If I started to rating it's all features, it will as followed (Out of 5 üåü):Processor ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êDisplay ‚≠ê ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êBattery ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êSound in loud ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êSound in 3.5 mm cord ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êCamera Selfie ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êCamera Back ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êNetworking ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êLack:There is no Fingers print sensor locked.There is no Back cover in the box.Camera quality not so good."
Value-For-Money & Recommended for a normal user,4,"  I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
Poor,1,  Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
Dont buy it as lower model is good then this,3,"  Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
BUDGET WORTHY PHONE,5,  Nice phone.. overall performance is just amazing
Poor processor basic UI also lagging,3,"  COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"
Compass is not working,1,"  Compass is not working, showing error as required sensor are not available,And everything is fine."
Please..... üôè don't Buy. Cheapest product from MiüëéDon't Believe in Paid Adverstiment,1,"  Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. üòû. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone üì±, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% üòÄ. The phone is too lightweight ‚ò∫Ô∏è and very handyüòÑ Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. üòÉ.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. üò≠GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. üò†üò†.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. üò•. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good üëçBut it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. üò†Display quality is too poor. üò´ Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. ü•∫  No led in front of the display.üò∞Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection üò•If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or aboveü§ó with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."

Redme 9A,3,  No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
Best under budget phone,5,  Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
Smooth and satisfying,5,"  Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
Good but not up to the mark,3,  Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
Awesome loved it,5,  It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
Excellent phone,5,"  Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
Stopüî¥üî¥üî¥,2,  Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
Cons and Pros,3,"  This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ‚ô•Ô∏è no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
Goooooooood,3,  Weary good product  very fast delivery
Points to be noted,3,"  Points to be noted:üëâ The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.üëâ This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.üëâ Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.üëâ Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.üëâ After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
Made in china,2,  Phone is good. But it is made in China
Best phone for PARENTS. 5/5 for Rs.6800,5,"  Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
Best in this price range,5,  Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
Wow,5,  Wow
Very worst,1,"  I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available.

I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
Good,4,"  Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
Screen resolution is not good & worst camera ever.. rest so so..,2,  Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
Value for money or not?,4,"  So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5‚≠ê for thatPros-‚Ä¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this range‚Ä¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.‚Ä¢Good for basic usage.‚Ä¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:‚Ä¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)‚Ä¢Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"
Average,3,  A little bit slow..I think it will more lagged afterwards..Big screen.Camera is not good.. As well as selfie..Ph is For normal users..
Not up to the mark,1,  Not satisfied. No camera perfection. No finger sensor. Perfect China piece. Cheap and worst. Started hanging.

"Waste of money, Worst customer service.",1,"  I am never going to buy any electronic product from amazon anymore. Experienced worst customer service. Product is not upto the mark. Over heating, network connectivity issue was there. They were using their aaps to dignose in which everything will be showing normal. The same aap can not be used in any other phones for checking. That means this aap is specifically designed by amazone for amazon bought mobiles. You will never know if this is correct or not. Based upon that refund/ replancement will not be done. Amozon update your customer service otherwise if customers make you customers can also break you. After 2 days of continuos chasing no result. Wasted Rs 7498/-."

Good price product,4,  Good product
Not recommended and a cheating,1,"  Amazon is now becomes a cheater, there is no way to return the item..it has below shortcomings..Poor Camera quality, though it has feature for Portrait and Landscape but in landscape mode the clicked pictures are blurred...Poor battery performance, the 5000mAh battery is so poor that it significantly heats up entire phone within  2-5 minutes and drains the battery. Weight is also quite more.I tried to return the item, it says have a test with some software or talk to technical team (after uploading no. of things, very tedious), there are many sites in which you can have hassle free return...You will get frustrated and defiantly could not be able to return the item..there is no way to interact on email and call..so select the items very very carefully..otherwise they are sitting there to cheat your hard earned money...be careful.."

"VoLte, VoWifi Not working!!",1,"  With Airtel Sim, neither VoLte and VoWifi are working in my phone. Airtel Thanks app is showing your handset is 4G but not VoLte compatible. Same thing in Vodafone. Is anyone else having this issue? Asked for replacement. Let's see what amazon do with this issue!Update: After my complaint, Amazon replaced my phone with a brand new piece. But the same issue happened with it also. So again I complained and I am so thankful to Amazon that they took my phone back and told me that they will refund my money. Phone was taken back, just waiting for my refund now.If you have a Jio sim, just go for it. It is an awesome phone but If you are Airtel or Vi customer then there will be some issue with VoLte and VoWifi."

We buyers must also do our homework before buying a high-tech product.,1,"  I want to share a live (semi-positive) experience with Amazon a week back. I purchased a Redmi 9A phone for my grandson on 21 Dec. The phone came on 24th, but wouldn't boot. I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't bootü•µAnother round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN üò¢üò¢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day‚ùóMoral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier üôè"
China DESH KA PHONE......,3,"  Why do you advertise this phone as DESH KA SMARTPHONE. Did you know, What is the meaning of DESH?. I thought of buying a phone by made in India. But Amazon delivered to me a phone by made in China. Not just the phone, the charger and charging cable are made in China!. If we buy a smartphone at a discount, will you behave substandard manner?"

Video Audio quality.,4,"  Phone is good and battery backup is very nice,working long time. But one thing i faced that i bought on first sale i found one problem that video recording audio not good very low hearing then i returned that one and get change  with new. After getting new one i found that problem is same and that not problem its phone problem. Phone video recording audio is very low compare to others phone. I can't hear clear voice in even low distance recording."
Best for Average usage.,5,"  Overall mobile is good for an average usage. Its camera, audio quality is average to good. Its performance is very good because of good internal storage.Handy as well as the screen is quite wide and provides good viewing angle.Plus point is its battery which is quite huge. Has microusb slot and charger is of 10W thats why charging might be somewhat slow (not that fast)If you want the mobile for an average usage then this can be a best deal for you.I got this 2gb Ram 32gb Rom varient in 6800 Rs.Or if your usage is high i would recommend to go for some other Redmi products for price beyond 8000 to 9000.Below 7000 this product gives satisfactory performance."
Leaves a sour taste,1,"  Pros:1. Performance is Ok, for the price.2. 2 SIM + 1 Micro SD Card Slot, i.e. no hybrid slotsCons:1. Too many advertisements and installs 3rd party apps forcefully. This is not mentioned in the listing. This should be made mandatory. But thankfully practically almost everything can be uninstalled.2. Micro USB port for charging is unacceptable in 20213. Used a MIUI based phone long time ago, somehow I feel it has become much worse and confusing. Even changing your notification sound or ringtone takes some effort and a little bit of scratching your head. They should include a manual LOL."
Very Nice budget phone.,5,"  Ordered Redmi 9A 3GB 32GB version, sky blue for my mother 2 days ago. Delivery was quick. The delivery guy also opened the package on request for assurance. Got the product as ordered.Initial impressions:Pros:Large screen, Nice color, good processor, ample RAM for daily normal user, good battery backup, drains very gradually even if you are on calls whole day. Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions. (Very good in daylight or external use.)One of the best phones available in the market at this price. I have given it 5 star for specifications in this price range. I ordered it with an offer.. More than what you can get from any other Indian brand in 7000 rs."
"Very Fast, Superb Video Calling Clarity",5,"  I was using iPhone 6s Plus and when I got this phone for Rs. 7,500, I was surprised ! It have more display clarity and camera clarity than my iPhone. Also it is as fast as my iPhone. Mi have combined All features of ios and Android in this Phone, that make this phone special compared to other Android Phones. Its OS is Mi modified version of Android. The modified version is very intelligent and smart. It have removed all the disadvantages of Android Phones. It have iPhone features like Face unlock, time lapse video, burst mode and exposure increase and decrese in camera etc.Sound clarity also superb.My Brother in the US have amazed to see the better clarity of video calling than my previos iPhone."

Basic android smartphone,5,"  A basic android smartphone for basic android experience. If you're looking for an entry level smartphone with android os then this is a phone for you. This model packs a 3gb ram and 32gb internal storage which is more than sufficient for your daily needs from Facebook to YouTube and anything in between.

"Most pathetic product - BE warned - DO NOT BUY !!! Battery, Memory and Bandwidth hogging phone.",1,"  This is the most pathetic product that I have ever had the misfortune to buy on Amazon - and you cannot return the product and hope to exchange it for something else because they do not permit ""RETURNS"" only ""REPLACEMENT""  - WITH THE SAME GODFORESAKEN PHONE!!!!!""It comes preloaded with MIUI and other inefficient memory, bandwidth  and battery draining bloatware and constant advertisements all over the place  - and there is no way you can disable them - by buying this phone you are compromising your data and security and paying for an advertiser to constantly bombard you with adverts for thoroughly useless products -  and you have to pay for the bandwidth he uses up.In an attempt to get rid of MIUI you cannot even flash a custom ROM like LineageOS or some of the other AltROMs cause the manufacturers of the device will not share the code. SO IF YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS DEVICE YOU ARE STUCK.Do not buy - if you happen to have paid for it then your fate is sealed - you cannot hope for a refund ---- better to spend that money on buying some cow dung - might help make a cow happy!"
Nice Phone for doing normal works,3,"  This phone is helpful in basic things, camera quality is not good at all, specially rear camera is not good it is really a 8mp camera but Redmi is saying it 12 or 13 MP...making fool to customers. Overall it is good for taking online classes, making calls, using whatsapp but not for gaming, you can play normal games but if you play games like free fire, it starts heating and lagging. Battery is actually 4800 mAh.."
"Durable phone, worth every single rupee!",5,"  I ordered the phone during amazon 1-month deepawali sale, when it was selling for Rs 6,800. I exchanged my old Redmi phone and got further Rs 3,600 off. Plus I made the purchase using HDFC Bank credit card and got 10% cashback. Net net, i got the phone for Rs 3,150.But buying the phone at a cheap price wasn't the highlight. Its performance has not disappointed me.The features have upgraded and the Redmi-9A offers more bang for the buck. Features are intuitive and easy to use. My contact list was restored in no time.The 13MP camera is really good and, in my opinion, as good as an iPhone. I am exploring the phone's features and it has been a pleasant experience for me.If you are looking to upgrade your phone then PLEASE DON'T LOOK FURTHER!Rajagopalan VBengaluru"
Worth for the money,5,  Worth for the money.. I dont see similar features in other brand for this price range. My parents liked it very much... Wish they added some headphones to this. The color really pop's I was little hesitant while ordering about the color. But it's beautiful üòçüòçüòç
DEFECTIVE PRODUCT RECEIVED,1,"  The bad news was that I received a defective piece (what I feared the most because many customers posted review about defect). The good news was that my refund was processed on the same day as I filed the complaint with picture proof as attached here as well and I received the refund amount within 3 days.Plus, there were these black parallel horizontal lines on the screen, which I just couldn't understand why it was there. The phone looked pretty good (colour and built wise). Maybe would have been a nice one if I hadn't received a defective product."
JUST GO FOR IT.. ü§©,5,"  Amazing phone in such a low price.Great don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick face recognition, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have dual Or tripple cameras because its single camera beats most of the dual and triple camera phones, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick and last thing don't think like its cheap so obviously it will have poor looks and downgraded, no in this phone this isn't the case. Overall I'll give full stars and attaching some samples which have been slightly edited with In built editor.."
Excellent Price!,4,"  I bought this phone in the sale for a ridiculously low price. Firstly if you are someone who uses a lot of apps then this phone is not for you. It is a basic android phone which can be used for photos, WhatsApp and a few others. For the price, one shouldn't expect more. If you load a lot of apps expect the phone to go slow.The build quality was surprisingly excellent and the call quality was also good. Watching videos was also good.Frankly, for this price, I cannot complain about anything.Excellent buy in my opinion."
A good exchange offer,4,"  Pros. 1. This was bought on exchange offer, and I got a good price for my old phone. The exchange was smooth and there were no issues. Was very happy with the transaction.2. I have had it for just two weeks. So I cannot comment on durability, etc. No problem so far. Everything is as described on the Amazon page.3. The phone looks good and I am happy with the purchase.Cons.  Because it was an exchange transaction, the phone was not delivered as fast as for a full cash transaction. I ordered on 25 January and got the phone on 6 February. But I was kept updated about possible delivery dates, etc. So I was not worried.All in all, well worth it."
Good product,4,  The product is good in this price range and as a xiaomi lover you can buy it
Cheap phone with lots of incorrect details,2,  The camera provided in the phone is not  13mp at all.Picture quality is not good and it does not reflect the true colors.its ok that it is a cheap phone but atleast they should mention the correct configuration. If you compare camera picture quality with nokia phones I must say that 2mp camera in nokia made phones have better picture quality that 13mp of this phone. Its OK that this is vewry cheap phone but customer should not think that they will get a 13mp camera. Samsung or nokia make phones with 8mp camera might have better picture quality.rest i can write once i use this phone for a month.
Good and affordable,5,  Very cool phone at this price and camera is average but overall I would recommend choose Redmond over realme
An attractive deal and a reliable phone,4,"  I bought this phone on the amazon prime sale. It was a great deal will a of discounts and I was able to buy it for under ‚Çπ9,000. I've been using this phone for almost a month now and here are my feedbacks.Firstly the good points. Very sleek, good screen size and the menus are user friendly. It has face unlock, pattern and pin unlock as well but no biometric. I can't be asking for more features for this price. 2 sim trays and one SD card tray which is great. I had been using both sim trays form this phone.Now for the bad points. I'm not able to set 2 different ring tones for each sim. So when a call comes in you can only tell by looking at the screen showing on which sim I am getting the call. Next, Screen brightness is not that great. On a bright sunny day, its sometimes not bright enough even if you turn brightness to the highest. Hotspot works fine but you cannot see how many devices are connected. Moreover, you also cannot see which device is connected. Then there are those unwanted, useless Mi apps that comes standard in the phones that send you notifications to upgrade and install even though those apps have not been updated by me.These are the major points. Apart from this, there seems to be no other issues. For a secondary phone this phone is great. Value for money."
Upgraded version of Basic Mobile,2,"  In the name of ""Budget"" phones, quality and features of the mobile is compromised. The camera quality is very poor. Adding to it, the mobile is full of bloatware which reduces the speed of the mobile. Most irritating is ads everywhere - In music, App explorer, Homescreen, in lock mode, wallpaper. You name it and there is an add"
Good quality under budget,4,"  Good product for budget price rangeBut camera quality is average otherwise, value for money  product"
Good,5,"  Happy to buy this good mobile , but little bit specs missing but value for money"
Worst experience,1,  Worst mobile within 10 days we got sound problem. Whatever I am playing no sound at all. After 10 days no return policy.
Dublicate product,1,  One of the Cheapest Chinese product in this category again. It is mentioned as 5000 mah battery in the specification but actually it is not upto the mark. Actually I bought this phone for my father as it has a bigger battery. But it drains automatically within 2 days when there is no usage. But redmi 8A which I am using presently is much better product when compared to this product.I don't know whether XIOMI is prescribing wrong speciation or AMAZON is selling a dublicate product. But my suggestion is don't buy this product even when you have little usage.

Decent product for its price!,4,"  Best choice for low budget.BATTERY:It is upto use. If you use light apps and its normal function battery last upto 5-6 hours approx.#Using heavy apps(games) definately hange the device and heat it up.CAMERA:Looking at its price camera is decent . Quality is not too good, but can capture your precious moments at a decent quality.WEIGHT:Weight is light easy to handle .Looks nice.VIDEO QUALITY:The experience is not that hd  but gives you a nice experience. Sound quality is also good.It doesn't have fingerprint sensor , there is no back cover."
For the price it is ok..,3,  A good phone for the price.Seems little bit lagging. Back camera good but front camera pathetic. Not good for elderly people because bit bulky.Display is ok. Some of the apps like Google nearby sharing and files go app file sharing is not working.For the price range it is ok..Auto display brightness is crappy..
Overall good phone for daily use but go for 3gb variant.,4,"  Phone is good those who want a decent phone for daily use but first of all turn off all annoying ads they provide. No doubt on built quality, it is solid, durable. Battery life is very good. Camera gets the job done for daily use. I have 2gb variant which I won't recommend for others because I can feel slight lag if 4 apps are in the background, Go for Poco C3 3gb variant as it is the same brand of Mi,also it has better processer n u get 500rs discount on HDFC debit card. I trust Mi for long term use, I never had bad experience. Thumbs up if you find this helpful."
Good in use,4,  Smart use
"Camera poor quality,Hang",1,"  Worst packaging,Camera poor quality,mobile hanging while opening apps in it.Product is little bit ok."
Purchased the 3GB/32GB Nature Green Redmi 9A at Rs. 7499,4,  Purchased the Nature Green colour case on 23 Feb 2021 and was delivered on 25 Feb 2021. I've used it for a good couple of weeks and reviewing this purchase on 09 March 2021.It's value for money. The Camera quality is good and battery life is long as well.Actually I've placed another order for the Sea Blue colour one today.I also purchased mobile case and tempered glass with this purchase. below are the detailsBracevor Hybrid Back Cover Kickstand Case for Xiaomi Mi Redmi 9A and JGD PRODUCTS¬Æ Tempered Glass for Redmi 9A-Edge to Edge Full Screen Coverage.
Pathetic Phone,1,"  Product is below average. This is third Mi phone that I bought and all the three have had network (card) problems. Camera clarity is good but takes 10 sec to launch.. again, poor experience. Battery is good, but compared to other phones in this range, it take double the time to charge... hence the fast charging option too is not at par.Overall A very poor experience with Mi phones. I'll never buy Mi phone in future and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE."
Don't Buy This!!!,3,"  I ordered this phone day after today and it has been delivered to me. I did not like this phone at all because this phone heats up quickly and the sound of the phone speaker is also very low. Therefore, I would suggest that you spend more than 2000 rupees. And buy other smartphones of Realme.But in this MRP it is good"
Fantastic Smartphone .....,5,  Good Smartphone in low budget lover for normal use.I gifted to my wife and she is very happy with phone and it's colors.I received within 4 days.Redmi needs to price 7000 with fingerprint function.Thanks
Good inexpensive phone,3,"  It comes with 2GB of RAM. The Redmi 9A runs Android 10 and is powered by a 5000mAh non-removable battery. The Redmi 9A supports proprietary fast charging. As far as the cameras are concerned, the Redmi 9A on the rear packs a 13-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture.Redmi 9A is not the best choice when choosing an inexpensive smartphone. It got a lot of flaws. On the positive side of Redmi 9A, there are high-quality assembly and materials of use. Also, the screen size is larger, decent battery life"
Good and worth it.,4,"  Got delivered on time. Best budget level phone. Has good outer body design with attractive colour.Specs are good and user interface is smooth and lag free.Cameras are okay, not great. Yes it has a AI mode for better usage.Gets warm while using but no heating issue. Came with 55% battery charge.Overall a good buy in this price range."
Overall good product,3,  Battery quality superb at this rate .long lasting.camera quality is not good as I thought.average camera.display is perfect. Not useable for gamers.aged people can use.overall good phone.kindly press the helpful button
Good mobile at 7k range,4,"  I bought this mobile to use it for calling purpose ,just needed an extra mobile for me. It comes with 3 gb ram and 32 gb hd., Which is suffice to me. Its a good phone for basic necessities like calling, browsing and apps, not a good camera, no fingerprint reader, battery life is good, charging is fast. It's a value for money if you looking at a mobile with 7k range with big screen size and 3 gb ram."
Don't Purchase this product...,1,  Issue started within 10 days of purchase of this product. My phone doesn't charge inspite keeping in charging for 2 hours.Amazon gave us 07 days replacement but the issue started on 10th day. Spoken to the team denied replacement of the product told us to go redmi service gallery for any issue. Now have to keep all my work aside and have to run behind the gallery people to get my phone repaired..Highly disappointed with the services from Amazon ..Worst Worst Product Don't buy people...

My previous phone redmi 7A was much better.Pros:Superb battery lifeBig screen (useful for browsing)Sturdy phone, has fallen a few times, nothing brokeConsDisplay resolution is badCamera is patheticHangs very often , when switching between apps"
Beaware!!!,5,"  In description, mention that the mobile is manufacturing by Rising Stars Mobile india pvt. Ltd., that is India, But see the picture, there mention Made in China.As per my coversation with Amazon as follows:1. Firstly they say...the batch or the lot which you have received possibly it's a old one.Me: how is this possible, after lunch, i purchase this phone on 2nd sale. How it could be old one.2. Amazon: From now onward the same product we are providing to our customers it's ""manufacturing in India"" this information is mentioned on the box itself.Me: what is this means, from now onward...Means previously manufactured in china or actual manufactured in china, there after comes to india and just replace the sticker.How is possible, a product made in India and print on that item other country name.I think they make people to fool and make money, just writing MADE IN INDIA.I request to you also, those are purchased this item please check the truth.And lastly this is possible on mobile/ any other products, those we cheated by amazon."
GOOD BUDGET PHONE,4,"  Redmi 9A is one of the most affordable smartphone by Redmi. It is available in two variants of 2GB + 32GB model priced at Rs. 6,799, while the 3GB + 32GB variant carries a price tag of Rs. 7,499.I Purchased on 23rd Sep.20.l expect it will be good. It is in great  demand. I think it's a good budget  Phone."
Very bad,1,  I hope these reviw help those who want to buy it is not good pohne at all as it hangups a lot for daily usade event the pohne also does not ha a type c which is downgraded. If you want to take these pohne it is bad opt even the delivery services also sucks and very bad service from amazon even i dont want to give single star also
Front camera is very disappointing during nightlights.,3,"  Overall it is a very budget phone.In 6799 it is offering 6.5 inch screen. Screen is good and HD. I don't expect much from this phone as I have gifted it to my wife,so no need of high end multitasking and speed performance but its front camera is very disappointing during night. It shows very blurry pictures in night. The dot dots are very much visible while taking pictures at night, just like a classic phone cameras of 2005 2010. I have used many MI phones ,the cameras was upto the mark,but this time its very disappointing.I was so disappointed with the camera that I ordered replacement but I cancelled it soon for not taking the headache of setting up the phone again. I think it wasn't the single piece defect. There's a degraded quality front camera in redmi 9A. In daytime there's no issue but it is not meant for pictures in nightlights."
Worst,1,  This is hanging a lot and they don't return it ..... Just replace the product worst phone don't go for it
Too Good to Handle in Daily life,5,  thanks Amazon for so good product at best price in the marketphone is very big size screen and 3 GB RAM is totally smooth function to operatecamera is too good and quality is goodall the functions are working properly and the best thing is that it has very nice grip in the back side
Hanging,1,"  Believe the review its hang much.Even in the calling tab when you touch on the search people it takes time.2gb ram what a joke its not even working like 1gb.My old redmi note 3 (2017) works greater than thisThis is so irritating.If you have budget issue, I will suggest you to buy other brand. if you want to buy only redmi then I will suggest you to don't buy any redmi phone that's falls under 10000."
Not much expected,3,  Camera quality is not much expected. Battery backup and screen size is good
Nice Phone in 2300 because i got it in a exchange of my old realme c2,3,"  Nice Phone in 2300 for me in exchange my realme c2Pros to be considered :-Camera -3.5* , nice picture in 13mp don't compare to 48 or 64 at this price i think it's better than my previous phone the photos look naturalDisplay - 4*  ,6.5 inch 720p big and nice display but could have been little brighterProcessor - 3*. The g25 is decent for daily useag but, They could have provided g35 atleast but in day to day nice performance , normal game running without any problem.Battery - 3.5* , battery life is nice can run whole day with normal and some gaming no problem but one issue they said it was 5000mah battery but if you check in any Phone information app on Google Play they show only 4100mah battery so you can check yourselfCons  to be considered:-Now there is no gyroscope or electronic compass in sensors , no or blaster ,no type c , no fingerprint sensor.In 7k i would not recommend this phone redmi 7a is much better deal or realme c3 , but since i got it in a exchange of only 2300 rupees i think it's bang for buck deal for me, but GST are increased to 18% so if you buy any 10000 phone you will pay 1800 or 2k to tex in government so smartphone prices are increased dramatically , that's why they are no longer value for money phone in smartphone market right now.Amazon service is really incredible for exchange, i try to exchange my phone through flipkart but they denied for no reason they have fraud exchange policy. But i have very nice experience with Amazon service , the delivery boy was good too ,Thanks for fantastic service Amazon.Thanks for your time and reading this long review.I will update later"
Super phone...,5,"  Phone looking is very niceBattery back up is very niceIn this price range ,this mobile is goodBut camara is not that much good but okNot coming any case along with mobile,they should have provided case.Over all mobile is very nice..."
Good,5,  Amazing product with this price
Go for it!,5,  The phone is good to give an elder person who does not need a very powerful phone. It's also gotta  large  screen that apt for reading. I say go for it as a budget phone. Gifted it to my mother... She is not the least bit tech savvy. I have not tried any heavy gaming on it so cannot say.The daylight photos are stunning and clear. Have not checked not time pictures.The charger get the phone charged pretty quick.Using it for fifteen days.Go for it!
A downgrade over Redmi 8A. Not worth it.,3,"  When you consider its predecessor the 8A/8A Dual, this one is a major downgrade. A sluggish Helio chipset, Type B charging port, an unnecessarily tall screen, bad camera all combine to deliver a not so VFM product. I am saying this coz I have the 8A Dual as well... Not impressed. With every series, there are too many compromises which is very much unlike Redmi"
Great value for money with low budget,4,  It doesn't comes with fingerprint sensor althought phone has massive battery with decent processors.charging around 2.5 hrs to complete from 0 to 95%. I didn't face any bugs right now. Made of this phone is excellent build quality and big screen added much advantage  it comes with 10w mi charger not supports fast charging.
Value for your money,3,  Value for money....Mediatec processor is bit slower.. dont expect a good cam..Frond cam was good  ...A good phone for older people who did not use much apps...6800 INR
Not so good,3,"  Camera quality is not as per the expectations, with 13 mp you get better camera quality but this phone has bad camera quality pics along with phone volume very less. Average phone i would say for regular use but doesn't justify it's specifications."
Radmi 9A,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
It sucks,1,"  Within 4 months of buying this phone, the storage was full. I didn't get even half of the 32 gb this phone bragged about. And that's all because of the useless pre-installed apps this phone comes with that no one, NO ONE, needs. I can't get rid of those stupid Xiaomi apps. This sucks. Never buying from Xiaomi again."
Good for below average users.,3,  The performance is not as good as specified in the discription. Camera parameters are good but the picture is not as good as it should be with these specifications. Overall it is good for below average users. But don't think of playing games on it as it hangs even on playing simple games like subway surfers. Battery is good and lasts about a day.
JUST A SIMPLE PRODUCT. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH,4,  To be frank it is a good product for the priceYou can't expect too much from it‚Ä¢The camera is ok type but not much features in editing the photos‚Ä¢There too many in built apps but they can be removed if not required‚Ä¢The screen is not bright at all its really dull to see‚Ä¢good delivery by amazon‚Ä¢Only good thing is that you get 3gb with 32 GB storage and a really big screen‚Ä¢It is good for people who don't expect much from their mobiles and use phones for a basic necessity‚Ä¢If you are looking for more features then I do not recommend this you have other options in this price‚Ä¢You also need to buy a cover and screen protector‚Ä¢The box only has the phone with charger and the manual with invoice of bill
Better to not to purchase MI products,1,  I am writing this review after 6 months....After 6 months phone was automatically restart & some time it will go to off mode it may takes 1 or 2 day's to  come back to on mode.... Service center guys saying bord issue but this boar was not available now....

Great Phone at this Budget and Ultra Fast Delivery.,5,"  I really Love Redmi Phones. My First Phone was Redmi 8A. I bought this phone as a Gift for my Dad.Great offers by Amazon for this Phone. You cant Buy a Super Smartphone Like this at a Price Range of 7500 Rs - 3GB  RAM Variant anywhere in the Online World or at Retail Stores. I love the Fact that Redmi 9A is Far Lighter than Redmi 8a. I ordered the Phone on 2nd November and i Got it on 3rd November. It was not even a Complete day, as there was 2 hrs left for a day to complete. Fastest Delivery by Amazon even for a Standard Delivery Order. I would love to continue my Shopping with Amazon.You can Go for this Phone Blindly.Such a Feasible phone. Love it."
Good deal for the price offered .,4,"  Overall the mobile phone is ok for the price , should have provided fingerprint scanner which is very common now , battery life is good , camera üì∏ is somewhat ok , look is good , very good for normal user , no hesitation in recommending this product ."
its good,4,"  Purchased for my dad, used past 10 days and seems good so far. Look and feel, build, battery life is good. Features are smooth. not played any games and also not done any multi processing so not sure about performance."
Good phone,2,"  good phone for money 7500, 32gb memory, 3gb ram enough is good for normal use, hd display awesome, Played game temple run, Visualation is outstanding, quick response in touch, sound quality average.

Worth for money,4,"  Writing this review after using this phone for some weeksThis phone is absolute worth for moneyBut iam not a giving a five star rating because iam ana ios lover and generally iam using ios phonesI brought this for my grandfather and by his opinion it's perfectBt i feel a problem that 3gb ram feature is only in it's boxSo if you are a game lover iam not suggesting this for you , but it's perfect for middle agedThe fingerprint sensor is fastBattery life is also goodAmd the camera quality is averge"
"Waste of Money, Worst Processor (MediaTek)",1,"  Battery is good , but mediatek processor is worst , too much hanging and slow processFor Adapter Data Cable is very short arround 1.2 feet , You need Buy One apart from this, it's a extra expense to buy a data cable.Only good thing is no heat producing on charging as well as normal usage , Battery is Superb, arround 1 full day if you are using continuousBetter go Redmi 8A DualSingle star for Redmi 9A, I wasted my money, there is no exchange options for this phone"
Review after 2 day use.,5,"  Camera quality: good image attached from both facing rear and front.Battery life : after full charge work 2 day with all the activities you can doFinger print : doesn't have finger printGlass and display : very crystal clear display but glass is not Corning gorilla.AI Face Lock: working good, some time it's not recognize."

Recommended,5,"  A very good item at this price range, bought two pieces for my kids, they loved it, they used it for playing games( Pubg,) they say it run smooth. Big battery..last whole day. Camera, sound and all other features are up to the mark."
Charger kit missing,1,  Need charger kit missing . Complained already raised . Not am issue my mobile .Am already paid temper glass and back cover . This explanation alt submit to customer care . Also my son study online class . Some education app . Already downloaded . So not possible submit to u my mobile . Need only charger kit. By krishnamoorthy .Advice to delivery person .
Nice Buy for parents,5,  I bought 2 GB Ram mobile for my parents. Its working well and surprisingly it looks slim and weight also less compare to other 5000mps battery mobiles. Big display is the game changer here. User friendly OS.For elders they dont need finger scanner . Finally satisficed with the all round impression under the price of 6200/-Average camera can not expect more at this price range at this moment.
Overall a good product in budget.,4,  I liked its processing speed which is very good. The ram is genuinely faster. Camera quality is average. Battery backup in this range is also good. The only problem with this model is that it does lack a good internet speed. I mean whatever sim card you are using this device will not give that much internet speed than what you expect. Sometimes the experience is horrible. The internet speed is very slow in this device whether you use any 4g sim. But what do you expect in this budget. It is a budgeted phone with some limitations.
Budget Friendly,3,"  Purchased this for my Mom. I don't say that this is an awesome mobile but I can tell you that at this price range it's okay to gift this to people for normal usage. Although the camera quality wasn't good at all, I was happy with the ram and storage provided at this price range.Camera Quality: 1/5Processor: 3/5Battery Life: 5/5Worth the money: 4/5"
Not at all happy with the product üòï,1,  I have ordered this Redmi 9A mobile phone as it is reasonable and compatible with my daily use as per the reviews which i got but unfortunately after owning it i have had very bad experience with the battery as it always heats up to the extreme and seems like it can explode any moment..and that too it was for the first time i have connected the charger and was shocked when it got heated up.I request the product approval team to please take a look into this issue with the product.I hope won‚Äôt be disappointed next time.Thank you!
How phone working,4,  Nice phone
- Phone hangs very frequently - Battery life is not reliable if you travel a lot.,3,  Like:- Features which exist in this price range of 6.5K -7K. Makes the phone affordable to many looking out for budget phone with an aim to use for 3 yrs.Dislike: Honest feedback from an educated & wise user.- Phone hangs very frequently (Even when space is enough nd the phone is new like 1 month)- Battery life expires in 24hrs. if you internet is on & talk continuously (I do due to my work). in 12hrs. if you watch too many online videos or listens music.
Value for money,5,  The product is awesome. Looking drop dead eye‚ù§
Nice product within the given price range!,5,"  Redmi 9A (32 GB) is a good mobile phone for those with limited budget. It has got all the nice features and functions. The screen is big, good fingerprint reader, amazing battery life, and a nice camera quality.The phone functions smoothly overall."
Cheap and best,4,"  It is worthable for this price, we can't play pubg and equal to pubg games. For online class this one much enough for the school and college students, it doesn't come with headphone,Camera quality rear is good and the front is OK for online class not for over exposure,It doesn't have finger print, screen size is bigger.I can suggest the people who is trying to buy this product.Seller send me the courier with safe and goodWe can buy it.Enjoy all!"
Best budget phone.,5,  I bought it for 5199 Rs with exchange (samsung J7) . I'm not much into camera or gaming. I bought it for daily use. Best battery life and good camera. Big screen makes watching movie great. Totally good buy for 5199 Rs.
Go for it if you have a tight budget!,4,"  1) Battery life is great!!üëåNo heating problem is found...2) Back camera is good in this price...3) While video recording with front camera i have found little bit hazy, but while taking selfie it is clear, could not understand why this is happening...4) Time taken for full charging from 20% battery life :- 2 hrs with its 10w charger5) Voice recording is very good & clear! Perfect for singers...6) A fingerprint sensor should be provided!‚òπÔ∏è7) Display is also Nice...8) Otherwise satisfied in this price..."
Decent. But worse camera,3,  Overall mob is good. They say it has 32gb storage available but when u get the mobile due to all internal apps u get only 20gb left. Never felt lag Or hang due to multie use of apps. Os quite ok. But worst thing is camera. It's almost same quality as some keypad mobile. And they have done a frod saying it's 13 mp but only 10 mp!!!!!!!!!! with badquality. And photos do not have shot on redmi. Exept camera overall decent mobile
Nice Phone at this price.,5,"  Redmi 9A is a good phone for normal use. The battery life is really encouraging. Battery lasts for almost two days even if Social medias are used. Sound quality is good, Camera is good at its level.Overall a value for money phone."
"Don't Buy,, Useless Camera,, Awesome UI",2,"  Don't Buy,, below avg Camera, for 13 MP, Its not even 2MP camera, Camera has very Low (live FP), MI WAS GOOD BUT NOW MI IS MAKING MONEY, My old MI 6 prime is better than this it has which cost 6000INR,, GO for RealMe C2,  same 13 MP camera for 7000 INR only, is Awesome... Dont Buy MI EVER they are making money now"
Good,3,  No finger print. Just below average phone. It's good for an average use. But its Worth of 7500. Good for online class. I think no other company gives 3gb ram and 32 gb memory with 5000 mah battery and fine camera quality. With 7500 rs
Wow redmi 3rd quality,1,"  This phone is looking good but working bad,very lowest quality phone.If I want search number with any alphabet in contact takes to much time ,all time slow working.So dont buy this phone .Other wise you will  realise after purchae me like because return window has close ,so I have no option.Waste my money."
Not good.,3,"  Direction sensor(magnetometer sensor)not in this phone.You can't get directionality when using maps(you will be always facing one direction.)Apart from this everything is fine for this budget.Not better than Redmi8A dual.I am satisfied with this phone because this is my secondary phone.But for thu guys who are having this as their first,you have better options if using a vouple of hundreds more."
4Star,4,  Redmi9A is really a best phone under this price but when we talk about its camera its third class and you can't buy this phone for photography purpose. Overall phone is good for normal working.
Excellent üëå,5,  My review after using it for 12 daysBest smartphone in this budgetSmartphone is very fast and smooth workingOnly defect is that the camera quality is average but at this price it's perfect
ordered on diwali sale,5,  when ordering your m-phone online you can't review cam. battery health etc.You might be wasting time.That's already available in bulk on YT.You can get detailed review of all there. Talking about order and exp. i've been ordering now since quite a while approx. mpre than 4-5years now.Delivery agent was quite polite this time.packing was excellent.product was up to the mark.every thing was good.Go for it![ amazon ]
Lovely,5,  Good product
Defective display panel,2,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†The dispaly went flickering from the moment I unpacked the phone and booted it. Disappointed and ordered a replacement. Issue didn't resolve even in multiple reeboots or taking MIUI update after first boot."
Not satisfied,2,  I ordered this phone 1 month ago in the flash sale ...that time I got that phone ..& it was written Made in India...But yesterday I received my 2nd phone.it is written Made in China...why is this? I am really confused...& My space button is not working at the time of contact saving.
Fabulous 1,5,"  Again 1 more redmi 9 series with our family. This time for our mother-in-law. We hope in first sights itself looks like made for her, simple and user friendly phone with all good feature's,,, great to go head,,,"

A great buy for Under 7k.,3,"  ""Battery life"" is great to be honest. i like the display tall, Bright. ""camera quality"" is not match any expectations. Expectations was quite average though for this price point. bloatware always been a hurdle for Mi phones.If You get it under 7K 3gigs ram go for kill.""Game performance"" was good as per the price G25 surprisingly Good processor. Overall a value for money. Ditching Fingerprint not a great option though."
Overall good performance,5,"  The one thing which every Xiaomi mobile is having is its abnormal weight compared to other mobile brand phones of similar features. The camera does not reach up to the expectation but the overall performance of the mobile phone is all ok. It has no fingerprint sensor, thus allows only face and other unlocking systems. An average person can definitely go for it if they dislike Vivo."
Even a one-star rating is more to it.,1,"  Just after 47 days of purchasing it, I got a problem with the phone. It started to reboot in a loop. Then I took it to the servicing center. The problem was resolved. I wish I could end this happily ever after. But, my happiness didn't last long. Hell! it didn't even last for 2 hours. The very next day I went to the servicing center again, the story repeats. SO I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE, as it's a waste of your time, energy, and money."
Phone,5,  The best phone üìûThis phone was good quality and camera and strogeBest priseNice phone üìû
Overpriced. Go for redmi 9i on Flipkart.,2,  Good battery life but expensive for this price tag as you can get redmi 9i at same price on Flipkart. Both mobiles are same but 9i has 4gb ram & 64gb memory.Go for Redmi 9i on flipkart.3gb ram lags a bit.
Exceptionally cool,5,"  Splendid trendy smart phone, great finish, touch sensors, display in par with more upmarket products.In a budget friendly way, suits basic function, üì∑ is good.Worth the price quoted.Thank you."
Great Mobile with all basic features perfectly matched,5,"  Excellent mobile, bought it for my mother great battery life and nice Camera for the price, My Mother makes phone calls watches YouTube and WhatsApp and she gets nearly 3 days of battery life, she is very happy, small problem is the earpiece sound is a bit low."
Nice phone,5,  Best mobile phone
Device is a pathetic,1,"  The phone quality is best but the performance isn't.The phone gets usually hang within 2 appa running in the background. You can't expect more From this device. I'm using this phone for only Calling purpose for my company sim. I have OP 7 pro for my uses, but this phone is really needs a strong software database, good camera quality, ram performance for smooth use."
Sought of Good Mobile at this price,4,"  The display of the mobile is good enough and battery life is awesome. Camera is you can say OK sought but what to expect in such a low price. A little bit hanging issue due to 2GB RAM , else otherwise everything is good. I got it for Rs.6120 (10% SBI credit Card discount) . You can go for it."

It's made in china,1,"  Don't buy this phone , it's made in China"
1 month with you another at service centre,1,"  Worst phone ever bought. After using for nearly 20 days it stopped taking charge. Service center found mother board fault & change it, after that in play store log in itself it turned off again permanently. 2nd service center visit updated the software & it started working. Now if I use it for 2-3 minutes continuously it restarts. Forget about gaming or any smartphone activity."
Not taking update,1,"  Not taking update for Google Chrome and webview system. I called up Amazon customer care, but they did not respond and behavior of customer executive was very wrost"
Average phone- serves its cost,3,"  Average phone, do not expect too much in case of performance. For first time touch pad buyers, if u have already used better configuration u won‚Äôt like it at all. This phone is to give a budgeted gift. Teenagers better put some more money and buy better one.."
Good product,4,  Quality is good in the price range below Rs 7000  battery does not last long and camera captured quality will be ok if you are looking for high quality camera or high battery back up you need to buy higher version model in higher price segment
A unbeatable budget kingü•∞,5,  Got the product today. I am so much happy with the build quality and look of the phone .No other phone have this asthetic look in this price segment.Camera quality also so good. Main attraction about this phone is its display. It's a big gorgeous HD panel in its segment.Considering all things redmi did a great jobWith 9AGO blindly with this product of your budget is 6999
Hangs a lot with a black screen and stops working,1,  Bought two phines and It's been 7 days only and both the phone starts hanging along with a black screen and then needs a restart.‡•§‡•§Worst part is I am not able to avail servicing facility by amazonAlso brand service is ignoring my complaints

You can watch 720p videoPerformance : No lag in day to day useage .Run smoothly every app.***No heating problemOverall product is good and value for money"
Average android phone,2,"  Heat problem and less battery backup, hope this will be fixed in android update."
good as a gift,4,  this product is for the people who are in search of average smartphone in an average price range. camera is a little average and it feels a little heavy probably due to its 5000Mah battery and large body but performance is good and there is no heat problem over heavy uses even. This is not for gaming purpose but i played lite games and performance was good. Overall good for general purpose.
Just Average product,3,  Its not an i was expecting. The disappointed me this time. As i come camera of redmi and other with same megepixel i found other much better than it. Battery is good you can use it full day and charger is also fast . But for very normal usage you can bought this product but if you are heavy user dont think about it. It lags sometime.
Excellent Phone at affordable price.,5,  The phone is excellent. Super fast charging. Camera is very decent. Screen is bigger than earlier versions of Redmi phone. Highly recommended.Go for it.üëçüëç
nice,5,  This product from redmi is fine under this price but the display is really bad i think so if you are willing to add some more money üí≤ then go for other product
"Terrible Face Unlock, No Fingerprint sensor",1,  1- Display quality sucks. 720p video seems like 480p.2- Cameras are terrific.3- Too much lags.4- Unstoppable Miui ads.5- Face Unlock usually takes 5-10 seconds and most of the time it doesn't work.6- No Fingerprint sensor.7- Battery is draining more quickly and fast charging is also gone after 5 months.Bottom line- Don't buy this Covid phone.
"Wrong Product, fake promises",1,"  Brought a phone only when it was written  it would be manufactured in India, but when it was delivered we got a made in China product ...... Absolutely fake promise by Amazon ...... When I initiated a replacement request there's no one to acknowledge..... Pathetic service.........!!!!!!!"
Network catching problem,4,  Phone is good. But mobile network catching problem very slowly.you tube not open in my mobile.sir I am very sad.please write down my information
Best phone of rs 6500,5,  I think it is the best phone of rs 6500 no othe company can give us so better product as redmi 9a it is very good phone for lite use but if u are a heavy user then u have to excess your range at 10000Sorry not for pubg or freefire users  but helio p25 is a good prossessor........... It also may not for a camera loveThanks for reading .............................. üôè

Made in china,1,"  Made in china, build quality bad, speaker also not good...pls go with redmi 9 or redmi 9 prime made in india version"
Good product for the price but could be better if included a back cover & screen guard,4,  Overall good product nominal peformance for daily tasks but not at all suggested for multitasking or gaming or photography coz AF its a budget phone so just fits right with the regular flow. No back cover & screen guard & takes lot of time to charge

Worst ever I seen.,1,"  Camera quality is not good,touch screen behaves unintended input when you make call by close by ear.Flash Light seems low power.Face locking system is not much better as expectation.No Magnetic Sensor, so you can't use compass feature or app.Some of bluetooth headset v5 doesn't works.*** I will suggest better to go for another ****"
Ok phone but as per price & performance its a little high priced,3,  Frequent call drops happen. Good screen etc & camera quality but battery is not that good especially if you have you are connected to data or wifi most times. Most annoying is the call drops & you have to redial & connect.Overall an OK phone which could have been priced lower with the quality it possesses
Don't purchase this.Go for any other phone .,1,"  The processor is extremely slow , even can't process Chrome browser efficiently .Absolute waste of money ,choppy apps.Camera is a disaster with lot of noise and poor light sensing technologyHigh contrast is visible in photos.Poor quality at low light .Don't purchase thisIf you r still here ,that proves u r dumb to think about purchasing this."
Worth buyable under this price.,4,"  Ordered nature green coloured mobile, Amazon delivered in 2 days. Colour is slightly different (dark) than what is visible on site. Battery performance is superb and processor performance is upto the mark. Indoor pics are not good with its camera."

Crashed and useless after 2 months,1,"  Worst mobile ever, within 2 months it got cashed. Everyone time i open the mobile it displays MiUi and got shut down. There is no option over Amazon to return/replace after 10 days now, where to complain to who should we reach out there is no clue at all."
"Third Class, too slow, waste of money phone",1,"  I specially recommended you to don't buy this phone. If you're planning to buy for your old parents or uneducated people meaning they will use only RED & GREEN buttons than you can buy otherwise please avoid buying.Too slow and hanging phone, talking about other features meaning insulted them.PURCHASING A FEATURE PHONE WILL BE GOOD INSTEAD OF IT."

Made in China,2,  The product is made in China and how mi is selling in India after the ban of Chinese phones in India.
worst mobile,1,"  Worst mobile ever, primary function of mobile is calling yet this mobile showing unique problem that on calling fellow person doesnt hear voice at all. as well service centre not able to solve problem. worst camera quality ever."
Good entry level device,4,"  I was looking for an entry level budget phone with latest features, this device serves the purpose, natural green color is awesome.  Beware, the device comes with 'Made in China' label."
Not buy 2gb ram,3,  The built quality is good not great if you are buying this please by the 3gb variant which gives more value of you by GB variant it will lag under 2 months
"Entry level, Value for money,",4,"  Battery life is good after use of intense calls, internet and video lasting for 3 days. Camera quality is good for entry level user. Value for money. So far not use for gaming."
Value for old exchange mobile,5,  Good! as purchased this mobile in exchange offer which is the best in deal. Good battery life. Good picture quality. Overall my experience is 10 out of 10. Thanks amazon for this wonderful exchange offer.
After using one month 9A,4,"  It is fully budget phone for mostly aged people to user smart phone, with low cost and high performance.If you want to use for long term and less use of apps and gaming then go for this 9A which is having good battery backup big screen with 3 GB ram etc."
Below average phone,2,"  It is very slow, lags a lot and hangs occasionally. It gets heated up if you use internet for long. No Gorilla glass, no fingerprint sensor, battery backup is good and camera is ok. Big screen with average display and Sound is a bit low. Dual apps and split screen function is missing. Its a low budget phone from Redmi. Go for better options"
Phone is slow,1,"  I found the phone a bit slow and lags in certain areas. Previously, I was using redmi 7a, 2Gb so I thought this phone might a good upgrade. But disappointed."
"Phone for people who uses Youtube, Whatsapp and for calls.",4,"  The product is decent in the price range. If you use the phone moderately only for calls, youtube or WhatsApp, then this is the best phone. I bought it for my mother and she felt happy, The screen is big and the battery is also good only if you use it moderately. Bought it for 6200 rupees."
Mobail so good and camera quality,5,"  Mobail so good and camera quality osm and battrary is so good, fingerprint one touch finger"
Not a good option,1,  1- Mobile is very slow. Skype app buttons response in 15 seconds.2- Touch of mobile is really bad.3- camera is also very poor.4- this mobiles comes with customised os. Which includes lot of third party apps which makes this mobile slow.5- finger or biomateic is not available.
Nice screen,5,  Battery life is good. I've been using it for 2 months now and it's great. It handles all social media apps very well and the calling audio quality is very good.
Terrible phone. Not even value for money.,1,  There is no magnetometer or gyroscope. Compasses wont work and even google map wont show which direction i am facing accurately. I bought it and regretted my purchase within the hour. No value at all for me. There is a lot of false advertising in other review websites which prompted me to get this.
Worth buy,5,  If you want to purchase a mobile under 6.8k it will be a better one. Giant display at 6.8k. Massive battery backup. Bought the mobile for Rs.6120 in great indian festival.
Slow as snail,2,  The phone is super slow. If one is navigating from one app to another it takes 5-6 second to open.If you open chrome it takes 10 second to open.Camera quality is not good (though the expectations from camera was not much).
9a mobile is good another,5,  Premium look..
Think twice.,3,"  Display and camera quality are too poor, else phone is ok, so it's better to spend few more buck for a better experience. However phone is good for new users."
Good From Xiaomi!,5,  Got this for 6400‚Çπ during the sale and feels like it satisfies the price paid for the device! Good product from Xiaomi! Go for it
POOR QUALITY MOBILE,3,"  I have been using the redmi 9A mobile for 7 months. Atfirst I think it will be good mobile, but now it seemed not good. Its scrolling is not smooth, sometimes it hangs, it shows full network signal but doesn't give net speed and even youtube doesn't continue smoothly. I don't play any online games like freefire or others. Camera isn't good. Only one thing is its battery is good."
WiFi hotspot doesn't connect to Laptop,3,"  Handset is fine for daily usage, video calling, zoom meeting etc. But the biggest drawback is its WiFi hotspot doesn't get connected to Laptop. I had tried several troubleshooting but nothing has worked. Really disappointed with this as I need to work on my laptop with internet on."
Not a Good Handset in,2,"  Not a good handset, its very slow and camera quality is not good. It had purchased it for my dad. Sold it back on olx after 1 month. The only best thing is battery. Charges quickly and runs long"
Super,5,  Excellent battery back upFingerprint reader goodCamera quality also good in this range especially capturing in low light.Overall good deal.

Not worth for money,1,"  Camera quality is poor, battery life is better. Don't get fooled by the average ratings. Never go for this. Go for some other phones at this rate please read reviews in another site before buying this phone.  Posting the review for third time. Hope this will get posted this time."
Too slow....not worth it...,1,"  Camera quality is not so good, initially I thought phone is nice. However, after using this, m so frustrated and it's too slow. It's a waste of money. Don't buy this. Once again telling, it's very very slow..... please don't refer my previous comment"

Everything is good except camera quality,4,"  I bought this mobile for my mom, she likes it. Everything is good in this mobile like display, sound, battery life, etc except the camera quality.

Awesome budget phone,5,"  Very good , I particularly like the large display and the immense battery ."
Super smartphone for older people (brilliant beginners phone)......,4,"  Decent phone for this price range. But I am not recommend this phone to any youngster who is approaching this phone with an intention to play games. If battery, decent camera (with gcam) are your  main concern then go for it. You can also enjoy other features which normal smartphone offers nowadays."
Worth the price,4,  The handset is good1. Great battery life.2. Display has good pixels.3. Screen is big.4. Ram speed is very fast.5. Camera quality is so so.6. Network hold a lot
Not upto the mark,2,"  It takes nearly 3 hrs to charge fully. And battery draining quickly, though they mention duration hrs as 2 days. Camera quality is ok not that much. And while charging mobile is heat up as I kept in fire.specifications seems to be awesome but disappointed with its working condition. We cannot spend 7k often with these issues."
Best Budget Smartphone at 7499üòç,4,"  If You Want to Buy a budget smart phone then really blindly go for this...With A Good Potrait Camera quality, good processor,3gb ram n of course a large battery backup almost 2 days battery life if you are a normal user. It doesn't have fm radio n gorilla glass protection overall it is a budget smart phone at 7500.Go for this"
Good phone,5,  I tried for 3 GB RAM phone but unfortunately got only the 2 GB one. Memory is the only one constrain noticed.
Long term review,3,  Happy with EMI option as it made the purchase affordable.Thanks Amazon.Product is good value.Would have liked a hard case to be bundled.The Micro USB charging port is cumbersome(User is a Senior Citizen)Would have preferred a non Chinese brand.
Plz ignore RKLLP seller - Box was not sealed when I received the product. Packing isn‚Äôt also proper.,4,"  Please choose another seller to buy this phone, RKLLP seller first experience too bad.Phone is okay with this price, looks great..."
Best mobile phone in that price range,4,  Great phone at that price point. Other leading brands do not offer these specs in that price range. Well built and really lightweight phone. Love the color though. Long battery life. Great for kids to attend online classes.
"Value for money,",5,"  Overall good product at this price point, Xiomi claiming made in India product, but we received made in China, I had never thought that I will get made in China product. It's very disappointing for me, Amazon delivering most of product  made in China."

Five star,5,  I have been using Redmi smartphone for the last 3 years. This one I bought for my mother. She likes it very much. Redmi never disappoints me.
Good,4,"  The ph is good latest os but no light for notification I had old Redmi model which had it,They have written 10w fast charger in box but I got 5w only."

Worst experience. Amazon please take off this mobile version and don‚Äôt sell this kind of faulty mobile versions . Be aware guys Don‚Äôt buy this and save ur money .
Very bad product,1,  Product is very bad. Mobile is heating up very much and screen colour changes after using it for ten days. Some heat waves comes out from the mobile. First time I received such a bad product from Amazon.
Nice phone.,5,"  The phone has a good battery backup (normal use) and nice design.The camera is okay. One problem that I noticed is that: the system apps use internet even the data is disabled. So, I have disabled the mobile data for all apps to avoid losing balance(since no data pack is active in that SIM)."
Decent Phone for a Decent Price,4,  There will always be Pros and Cons even if you buy a lac phone but for this price it justifies the quality and features fairly
"Long battery life, great functionality and fast",4,"  Good, easy to use, functional phone with good speed and apps. I need to charge only twice a week which is awesome. The camera quality is just average or a bit under but that is not why I bought this phone. Other than the picture/video qlty, everything else is awesome. Great value for money."
Good colour and designed,5,  It's battery life and memory are remarkable. It's a great experience to use a redmi phone in this price. It's really a great product
Worth the price!,4,"  Thank you Amazon for delivering the product superfast. The Redmi 9A mobile is worth the price. Not much expectations from the range yet it functions optimum. Good battery, smooth operation, easy AI response for camera and good processing speed."
Nice,3,"  This phone only for simple usage persons or children, don't expect high performance but best in this price segment"
I lost my trust in MI.,1,  I lost my trust in MI.I really dilike its quality. Means this phone is hanging since the day i start using it.Toally dissastisfied with it .Waste of money!Waste of efforts!I will never every buy any phone of MI. As it hangs.
Best Phone in 7K price range!,5,"  If you ask for one word to describe Redmi 9A it is 'smooth'. It functions effortlessly with 3GB RAM, and every feature sails without nay trouble. Camera is the only con, but how much can one expect in this price range. Well done, Redmi."
Nice phone in this budget,4,  Battery is very very good and other features is also very good in this price. Only negative thing in this phone is weight
Value for money,2,  Value for money but it goes to hanging mode many times.  Had to update the Android.  After that it started working well but it keeps happening. That is irritating.
Camera is cheap n worst but average  phone is good,3,"  With camera not happy, another brand in this range gives good AVG camera ,but all avg it is working well ,writing this after using this phone for 3 months"
Value for money,4,  Due to 2GB ram and pre installed redmi apps the phone is bit laggy but as per price and brand its good. Go for nature green colour its awesome!
Probably the best we can get in this price range,5,"  Got it for my mom, she uses it for over 8h at a stretch, and still has quite a battery life. Redmi has been improving monstrously. The camera quality is so so, but we don't aim for professional photography with it so doesn't bother, performance wise it's the best in this price range"
overall good experience,3,  what do you expect in this price range?. mi has bundled pretty much everything in it. plus blue is also my favourite color so if you are planning to buy it just go for it. good phone at this price range.

Problem not happy,1,  Problem im not happy
Don't buy this phone,1,  Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
One of the good choice for low budget phone,4,  If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
Bad camera and made in China,1,  Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
Simply excellent. Read complete review written after my 30 days of experience,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."

Value-For-Money & Recommended for a normal user,4,"  I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
Poor,1,  Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
Dont buy it as lower model is good then this,3,"  Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
BUDGET WORTHY PHONE,5,  Nice phone.. overall performance is just amazing
Poor processor basic UI also lagging,3,"  COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"

Please..... üôè don't Buy. Cheapest product from MiüëéDon't Believe in Paid Adverstiment,1,"  Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. üòû. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone üì±, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% üòÄ. The phone is too lightweight ‚ò∫Ô∏è and very handyüòÑ Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. üòÉ.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. üò≠GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. üò†üò†.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. üò•. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good üëçBut it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. üò†Display quality is too poor. üò´ Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. ü•∫  No led in front of the display.üò∞Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection üò•If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or aboveü§ó with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."

Useless phone,1,  Redmi 9A launched useless phone everTotally waste moneySo please not buying this phone
Winner of the caparison by price is the realme.,3,  REALME batter than redmi now
Value for Money. Well done Redmi.,5,"  1. Display is excellent. Colors and sharpness is good.2. Descent cameras according to price.3. In hand feel of phone is good. It's slim and despite 5000 Mah battery, it feels light.4. Battery backup is good. Easily last one day.5. Performance is good according to price. Mediatek G25 does it job well. You can play COD and FREE FIRE easily at low settings.6. Speaker loudness is average but quality is good.7. MIUI 12 experience is amazing. No ads and reduced bloatware."

nice product,4,  Quite goodBattery and build quality is betterBut camera and speakers are okok.
Over all Ok,4,"  Advantage :3GB+32 For Rs. 7498/-With 6.5 Inch & 5000 mah Battery Acceptable.Disadvantage :*No Finger Print Sensor*Front Camera is 5 MP Only, if it's 8 MP & Rear Side 13+5 MP means little acceptable.Over all Ok."
Redme 9A,3,  No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
Best under budget phone,5,  Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
Smooth and satisfying,5,"  Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
Good but not up to the mark,3,  Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
Awesome loved it,5,  It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
Excellent phone,5,"  Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
Stopüî¥üî¥üî¥,2,  Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
Cons and Pros,3,"  This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ‚ô•Ô∏è no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
Goooooooood,3,  Weary good product  very fast delivery
Points to be noted,3,"  Points to be noted:üëâ The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.üëâ This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.üëâ Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.üëâ Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.üëâ After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
Made in china,2,  Phone is good. But it is made in China
Best phone for PARENTS. 5/5 for Rs.6800,5,"  Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
Best in this price range,5,  Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
Wow,5,  Wow
Very worst,1,"  I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
Good,4,"  Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
Screen resolution is not good & worst camera ever.. rest so so..,2,  Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
Value for money or not?,4,"  So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5‚≠ê for thatPros-‚Ä¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this range‚Ä¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.‚Ä¢Good for basic usage.‚Ä¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:‚Ä¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)‚Ä¢Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"
Average,3,  A little bit slow..I think it will more lagged afterwards..Big screen.Camera is not good.. As well as selfie..Ph is For normal users..
Not up to the mark,1,  Not satisfied. No camera perfection. No finger sensor. Perfect China piece. Cheap and worst. Started hanging.
Nice deal in this price,3,  Pros-A big batteryBig screenGood lookNice processorValue for moneyCons-Poor camera quality both front and backDoesnt charge fastNo finger print sensor
Good entry level phone.however check what ur getting into,4,"  Good entry level phonePros: Big screen, MIUI12, Good batterly last for more than a day with average use,good cameraCons: single rear camera, no Corning glass screen,No radio, plastic back, 10w charger in box- takes long time to charge"

Scree size is too much narrow like 5 inch.  Mobille,1,  It's.  Cheating screen size 6.53 but too much narro . You can use only about 5 inch . And company has not write Anny pllace about screenn width size.6.53 is cover is in. Lenth ..So polease do not buy if. You want a big sacree mobile

"Waste of money, Worst customer service.",1,"  I am never going to buy any electronic product from amazon anymore. Experienced worst customer service. Product is not upto the mark. Over heating, network connectivity issue was there. They were using their aaps to dignose in which everything will be showing normal. The same aap can not be used in any other phones for checking. That means this aap is specifically designed by amazone for amazon bought mobiles. You will never know if this is correct or not. Based upon that refund/ replancement will not be done. Amozon update your customer service otherwise if customers make you customers can also break you. After 2 days of continuos chasing no result. Wasted Rs 7498/-."

Not recommended and a cheating,1,"  Amazon is now becomes a cheater, there is no way to return the item..it has below shortcomings..Poor Camera quality, though it has feature for Portrait and Landscape but in landscape mode the clicked pictures are blurred...Poor battery performance, the 5000mAh battery is so poor that it significantly heats up entire phone within  2-5 minutes and drains the battery. Weight is also quite more.I tried to return the item, it says have a test with some software or talk to technical team (after uploading no. of things, very tedious), there are many sites in which you can have hassle free return...You will get frustrated and defiantly could not be able to return the item..there is no way to interact on email and call..so select the items very very carefully..otherwise they are sitting there to cheat your hard earned money...be careful.."

"VoLte, VoWifi Not working!!",1,"  With Airtel Sim, neither VoLte and VoWifi are working in my phone. Airtel Thanks app is showing your handset is 4G but not VoLte compatible. Same thing in Vodafone. Is anyone else having this issue? Asked for replacement. Let's see what amazon do with this issue!Update: After my complaint, Amazon replaced my phone with a brand new piece. But the same issue happened with it also. So again I complained and I am so thankful to Amazon that they took my phone back and told me that they will refund my money. Phone was taken back, just waiting for my refund now.If you have a Jio sim, just go for it. It is an awesome phone but If you are Airtel or Vi customer then there will be some issue with VoLte and VoWifi."
Sea Blue ?? DARK BLUE IT IS....,3,"  The listing states SEA BLUE color.... Well its DARK DARK BLUE (Indigo/Purple type); so very disappointed there..otherwise Phone is overall good...4 Stars for Phone specs,2 Stars for wrong Color mention,So Overall 3 Starts Avreage!!"
We buyers must also do our homework before buying a high-tech product.,1,"  I want to share a live (semi-positive) experience with Amazon a week back. I purchased a Redmi 9A phone for my grandson on 21 Dec. The phone came on 24th, but wouldn't boot. I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't bootü•µAnother round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN üò¢üò¢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day‚ùóMoral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier üôè"
China DESH KA PHONE......,3,"  Why do you advertise this phone as DESH KA SMARTPHONE. Did you know, What is the meaning of DESH?. I thought of buying a phone by made in India. But Amazon delivered to me a phone by made in China. Not just the phone, the charger and charging cable are made in China!. If we buy a smartphone at a discount, will you behave substandard manner?"

Video Audio quality.,4,"  Phone is good and battery backup is very nice,working long time. But one thing i faced that i bought on first sale i found one problem that video recording audio not good very low hearing then i returned that one and get change  with new. After getting new one i found that problem is same and that not problem its phone problem. Phone video recording audio is very low compare to others phone. I can't hear clear voice in even low distance recording."
Best for Average usage.,5,"  Overall mobile is good for an average usage. Its camera, audio quality is average to good. Its performance is very good because of good internal storage.Handy as well as the screen is quite wide and provides good viewing angle.Plus point is its battery which is quite huge. Has microusb slot and charger is of 10W thats why charging might be somewhat slow (not that fast)If you want the mobile for an average usage then this can be a best deal for you.I got this 2gb Ram 32gb Rom varient in 6800 Rs.Or if your usage is high i would recommend to go for some other Redmi products for price beyond 8000 to 9000.Below 7000 this product gives satisfactory performance."
Leaves a sour taste,1,"  Pros:1. Performance is Ok, for the price.2. 2 SIM + 1 Micro SD Card Slot, i.e. no hybrid slotsCons:1. Too many advertisements and installs 3rd party apps forcefully. This is not mentioned in the listing. This should be made mandatory. But thankfully practically almost everything can be uninstalled.2. Micro USB port for charging is unacceptable in 20213. Used a MIUI based phone long time ago, somehow I feel it has become much worse and confusing. Even changing your notification sound or ringtone takes some effort and a little bit of scratching your head. They should include a manual LOL."
Very Nice budget phone.,5,"  Ordered Redmi 9A 3GB 32GB version, sky blue for my mother 2 days ago. Delivery was quick. The delivery guy also opened the package on request for assurance. Got the product as ordered.Initial impressions:Pros:Large screen, Nice color, good processor, ample RAM for daily normal user, good battery backup, drains very gradually even if you are on calls whole day. Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions. (Very good in daylight or external use.)One of the best phones available in the market at this price. I have given it 5 star for specifications in this price range. I ordered it with an offer.. More than what you can get from any other Indian brand in 7000 rs."
"Very Fast, Superb Video Calling Clarity",5,"  I was using iPhone 6s Plus and when I got this phone for Rs. 7,500, I was surprised ! It have more display clarity and camera clarity than my iPhone. Also it is as fast as my iPhone. Mi have combined All features of ios and Android in this Phone, that make this phone special compared to other Android Phones. Its OS is Mi modified version of Android. The modified version is very intelligent and smart. It have removed all the disadvantages of Android Phones. It have iPhone features like Face unlock, time lapse video, burst mode and exposure increase and decrese in camera etc.Sound clarity also superb.My Brother in the US have amazed to see the better clarity of video calling than my previos iPhone."

Basic android smartphone,5,"  A basic android smartphone for basic android experience. If you're looking for an entry level smartphone with android os then this is a phone for you. This model packs a 3gb ram and 32gb internal storage which is more than sufficient for your daily needs from Facebook to YouTube and anything in between. If you want a basic android experience or just want a phone for your daily driver this one is for you. Do note this ain't optimal for heavy duty gaming. Casual gaming yes, but not heavy duty gaming."

"Most pathetic product - BE warned - DO NOT BUY !!! Battery, Memory and Bandwidth hogging phone.",1,"  This is the most pathetic product that I have ever had the misfortune to buy on Amazon - and you cannot return the product and hope to exchange it for something else because they do not permit ""RETURNS"" only ""REPLACEMENT""  - WITH THE SAME GODFORESAKEN PHONE!!!!!""It comes preloaded with MIUI and other inefficient memory, bandwidth  and battery draining bloatware and constant advertisements all over the place  - and there is no way you can disable them - by buying this phone you are compromising your data and security and paying for an advertiser to constantly bombard you with adverts for thoroughly useless products -  and you have to pay for the bandwidth he uses up.In an attempt to get rid of MIUI you cannot even flash a custom ROM like LineageOS or some of the other AltROMs cause the manufacturers of the device will not share the code. SO IF YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS DEVICE YOU ARE STUCK.Do not buy - if you happen to have paid for it then your fate is sealed - you cannot hope for a refund ---- better to spend that money on buying some cow dung - might help make a cow happy!"
Nice Phone for doing normal works,3,"  This phone is helpful in basic things, camera quality is not good at all, specially rear camera is not good it is really a 8mp camera but Redmi is saying it 12 or 13 MP...making fool to customers. Overall it is good for taking online classes, making calls, using whatsapp but not for gaming, you can play normal games but if you play games like free fire, it starts heating and lagging. Battery is actually 4800 mAh.."
"Durable phone, worth every single rupee!",5,"  I ordered the phone during amazon 1-month deepawali sale, when it was selling for Rs 6,800. I exchanged my old Redmi phone and got further Rs 3,600 off. Plus I made the purchase using HDFC Bank credit card and got 10% cashback. Net net, i got the phone for Rs 3,150.But buying the phone at a cheap price wasn't the highlight. Its performance has not disappointed me.The features have upgraded and the Redmi-9A offers more bang for the buck. Features are intuitive and easy to use. My contact list was restored in no time.The 13MP camera is really good and, in my opinion, as good as an iPhone. I am exploring the phone's features and it has been a pleasant experience for me.If you are looking to upgrade your phone then PLEASE DON'T LOOK FURTHER!Rajagopalan VBengaluru"
Worth for the money,5,  Worth for the money.. I dont see similar features in other brand for this price range. My parents liked it very much... Wish they added some headphones to this. The color really pop's I was little hesitant while ordering about the color. But it's beautiful üòçüòçüòç
DEFECTIVE PRODUCT RECEIVED,1,"  The bad news was that I received a defective piece (what I feared the most because many customers posted review about defect). The good news was that my refund was processed on the same day as I filed the complaint with picture proof as attached here as well and I received the refund amount within 3 days.Plus, there were these black parallel horizontal lines on the screen, which I just couldn't understand why it was there. The phone looked pretty good (colour and built wise). Maybe would have been a nice one if I hadn't received a defective product."
JUST GO FOR IT.. ü§©,5,"  Amazing phone in such a low price.Great don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick face recognition, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have dual Or tripple cameras because its single camera beats most of the dual and triple camera phones, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick and last thing don't think like its cheap so obviously it will have poor looks and downgraded, no in this phone this isn't the case. Overall I'll give full stars and attaching some samples which have been slightly edited with In built editor.."
Excellent Price!,4,"  I bought this phone in the sale for a ridiculously low price. Firstly if you are someone who uses a lot of apps then this phone is not for you. It is a basic android phone which can be used for photos, WhatsApp and a few others. For the price, one shouldn't expect more. If you load a lot of apps expect the phone to go slow.The build quality was surprisingly excellent and the call quality was also good. Watching videos was also good.Frankly, for this price, I cannot complain about anything.Excellent buy in my opinion."
A good exchange offer,4,"  Pros. 1. This was bought on exchange offer, and I got a good price for my old phone. The exchange was smooth and there were no issues. Was very happy with the transaction.2. I have had it for just two weeks. So I cannot comment on durability, etc. No problem so far. Everything is as described on the Amazon page.3. The phone looks good and I am happy with the purchase.Cons.  Because it was an exchange transaction, the phone was not delivered as fast as for a full cash transaction. I ordered on 25 January and got the phone on 6 February. But I was kept updated about possible delivery dates, etc. So I was not worried.All in all, well worth it."
Good product,4,  The product is good in this price range and as a xiaomi lover you can buy it
Cheap phone with lots of incorrect details,2,  The camera provided in the phone is not  13mp at all.Picture quality is not good and it does not reflect the true colors.its ok that it is a cheap phone but atleast they should mention the correct configuration. If you compare camera picture quality with nokia phones I must say that 2mp camera in nokia made phones have better picture quality that 13mp of this phone. Its OK that this is vewry cheap phone but customer should not think that they will get a 13mp camera. Samsung or nokia make phones with 8mp camera might have better picture quality.rest i can write once i use this phone for a month.
Good and affordable,5,  Very cool phone at this price and camera is average but overall I would recommend choose Redmond over realme
An attractive deal and a reliable phone,4,"  I bought this phone on the amazon prime sale. It was a great deal will a of discounts and I was able to buy it for under ‚Çπ9,000. I've been using this phone for almost a month now and here are my feedbacks.Firstly the good points. Very sleek, good screen size and the menus are user friendly. It has face unlock, pattern and pin unlock as well but no biometric. I can't be asking for more features for this price. 2 sim trays and one SD card tray which is great. I had been using both sim trays form this phone.Now for the bad points. I'm not able to set 2 different ring tones for each sim. So when a call comes in you can only tell by looking at the screen showing on which sim I am getting the call. Next, Screen brightness is not that great. On a bright sunny day, its sometimes not bright enough even if you turn brightness to the highest. Hotspot works fine but you cannot see how many devices are connected. Moreover, you also cannot see which device is connected. Then there are those unwanted, useless Mi apps that comes standard in the phones that send you notifications to upgrade and install even though those apps have not been updated by me.These are the major points. Apart from this, there seems to be no other issues. For a secondary phone this phone is great. Value for money."
Upgraded version of Basic Mobile,2,"  In the name of ""Budget"" phones, quality and features of the mobile is compromised. The camera quality is very poor. Adding to it, the mobile is full of bloatware which reduces the speed of the mobile. Most irritating is ads everywhere - In music, App explorer, Homescreen, in lock mode, wallpaper. You name it and there is an add"
Good quality under budget,4,"  Good product for budget price rangeBut camera quality is average otherwise, value for money  product"
Good,5,"  Happy to buy this good mobile , but little bit specs missing but value for money"
Worst experience,1,  Worst mobile within 10 days we got sound problem. Whatever I am playing no sound at all. After 10 days no return policy.
Dublicate product,1,  One of the Cheapest Chinese product in this category again. It is mentioned as 5000 mah battery in the specification but actually it is not upto the mark. Actually I bought this phone for my father as it has a bigger battery. But it drains automatically within 2 days when there is no usage. But redmi 8A which I am using presently is much better product when compared to this product.I don't know whether XIOMI is prescribing wrong speciation or AMAZON is selling a dublicate product. But my suggestion is don't buy this product even when you have little usage.

Decent product for its price!,4,"  Best choice for low budget.BATTERY:It is upto use. If you use light apps and its normal function battery last upto 5-6 hours approx.#Using heavy apps(games) definately hange the device and heat it up.CAMERA:Looking at its price camera is decent . Quality is not too good, but can capture your precious moments at a decent quality.WEIGHT:Weight is light easy to handle .Looks nice.VIDEO QUALITY:The experience is not that hd  but gives you a nice experience. Sound quality is also good.It doesn't have fingerprint sensor , there is no back cover."
For the price it is ok..,3,  A good phone for the price.Seems little bit lagging. Back camera good but front camera pathetic. Not good for elderly people because bit bulky.Display is ok. Some of the apps like Google nearby sharing and files go app file sharing is not working.For the price range it is ok..Auto display brightness is crappy..
Overall good phone for daily use but go for 3gb variant.,4,"  Phone is good those who want a decent phone for daily use but first of all turn off all annoying ads they provide. No doubt on built quality, it is solid, durable. Battery life is very good. Camera gets the job done for daily use. I have 2gb variant which I won't recommend for others because I can feel slight lag if 4 apps are in the background, Go for Poco C3 3gb variant as it is the same brand of Mi,also it has better processer n u get 500rs discount on HDFC debit card. I trust Mi for long term use, I never had bad experience. Thumbs up if you find this helpful."
Good in use,4,  Smart use

Purchased the 3GB/32GB Nature Green Redmi 9A at Rs. 7499,4,  Purchased the Nature Green colour case on 23 Feb 2021 and was delivered on 25 Feb 2021. I've used it for a good couple of weeks and reviewing this purchase on 09 March 2021.It's value for money. The Camera quality is good and battery life is long as well.Actually I've placed another order for the Sea Blue colour one today.I also purchased mobile case and tempered glass with this purchase. below are the detailsBracevor Hybrid Back Cover Kickstand Case for Xiaomi Mi Redmi 9A and JGD PRODUCTS¬Æ Tempered Glass for Redmi 9A-Edge to Edge Full Screen Coverage.
Pathetic Phone,1,"  Product is below average. This is third Mi phone that I bought and all the three have had network (card) problems. Camera clarity is good but takes 10 sec to launch.. again, poor experience. Battery is good, but compared to other phones in this range, it take double the time to charge... hence the fast charging option too is not at par.Overall A very poor experience with Mi phones. I'll never buy Mi phone in future and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE."
Don't Buy This!!!,3,"  I ordered this phone day after today and it has been delivered to me. I did not like this phone at all because this phone heats up quickly and the sound of the phone speaker is also very low. Therefore, I would suggest that you spend more than 2000 rupees. And buy other smartphones of Realme.But in this MRP it is good"
Fantastic Smartphone .....,5,  Good Smartphone in low budget lover for normal use.I gifted to my wife and she is very happy with phone and it's colors.I received within 4 days.Redmi needs to price 7000 with fingerprint function.Thanks
Good inexpensive phone,3,"  It comes with 2GB of RAM. The Redmi 9A runs Android 10 and is powered by a 5000mAh non-removable battery. The Redmi 9A supports proprietary fast charging. As far as the cameras are concerned, the Redmi 9A on the rear packs a 13-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture.Redmi 9A is not the best choice when choosing an inexpensive smartphone. It got a lot of flaws. On the positive side of Redmi 9A, there are high-quality assembly and materials of use. Also, the screen size is larger, decent battery life"
Good and worth it.,4,"  Got delivered on time. Best budget level phone. Has good outer body design with attractive colour.Specs are good and user interface is smooth and lag free.Cameras are okay, not great. Yes it has a AI mode for better usage.Gets warm while using but no heating issue. Came with 55% battery charge.Overall a good buy in this price range."
Overall good product,3,  Battery quality superb at this rate .long lasting.camera quality is not good as I thought.average camera.display is perfect. Not useable for gamers.aged people can use.overall good phone.kindly press the helpful button
Good mobile at 7k range,4,"  I bought this mobile to use it for calling purpose ,just needed an extra mobile for me. It comes with 3 gb ram and 32 gb hd., Which is suffice to me. Its a good phone for basic necessities like calling, browsing and apps, not a good camera, no fingerprint reader, battery life is good, charging is fast. It's a value for money if you looking at a mobile with 7k range with big screen size and 3 gb ram."
Don't Purchase this product...,1,  Issue started within 10 days of purchase of this product. My phone doesn't charge inspite keeping in charging for 2 hours.Amazon gave us 07 days replacement but the issue started on 10th day. Spoken to the team denied replacement of the product told us to go redmi service gallery for any issue. Now have to keep all my work aside and have to run behind the gallery people to get my phone repaired..Highly disappointed with the services from Amazon ..Worst Worst Product Don't buy people...

Beaware!!!,5,"  In description, mention that the mobile is manufacturing by Rising Stars Mobile india pvt. Ltd., that is India, But see the picture, there mention Made in China.As per my coversation with Amazon as follows:1. Firstly they say...the batch or the lot which you have received possibly it's a old one.Me: how is this possible, after lunch, i purchase this phone on 2nd sale. How it could be old one.2. Amazon: From now onward the same product we are providing to our customers it's ""manufacturing in India"" this information is mentioned on the box itself.Me: what is this means, from now onward...Means previously manufactured in china or actual manufactured in china, there after comes to india and just replace the sticker.How is possible, a product made in India and print on that item other country name.I think they make people to fool and make money, just writing MADE IN INDIA.I request to you also, those are purchased this item please check the truth.And lastly this is possible on mobile/ any other products, those we cheated by amazon."
GOOD BUDGET PHONE,4,"  Redmi 9A is one of the most affordable smartphone by Redmi. It is available in two variants of 2GB + 32GB model priced at Rs. 6,799, while the 3GB + 32GB variant carries a price tag of Rs. 7,499.I Purchased on 23rd Sep.20.l expect it will be good. It is in great  demand. I think it's a good budget  Phone."
Very bad,1,  I hope these reviw help those who want to buy it is not good pohne at all as it hangups a lot for daily usade event the pohne also does not ha a type c which is downgraded. If you want to take these pohne it is bad opt even the delivery services also sucks and very bad service from amazon even i dont want to give single star also
Front camera is very disappointing during nightlights.,3,"  Overall it is a very budget phone.In 6799 it is offering 6.5 inch screen. Screen is good and HD. I don't expect much from this phone as I have gifted it to my wife,so no need of high end multitasking and speed performance but its front camera is very disappointing during night. It shows very blurry pictures in night. The dot dots are very much visible while taking pictures at night, just like a classic phone cameras of 2005 2010. I have used many MI phones ,the cameras was upto the mark,but this time its very disappointing.I was so disappointed with the camera that I ordered replacement but I cancelled it soon for not taking the headache of setting up the phone again. I think it wasn't the single piece defect. There's a degraded quality front camera in redmi 9A. In daytime there's no issue but it is not meant for pictures in nightlights."
Worst,1,  This is hanging a lot and they don't return it ..... Just replace the product worst phone don't go for it
Too Good to Handle in Daily life,5,  thanks Amazon for so good product at best price in the marketphone is very big size screen and 3 GB RAM is totally smooth function to operatecamera is too good and quality is goodall the functions are working properly and the best thing is that it has very nice grip in the back side
Hanging,1,"  Believe the review its hang much.Even in the calling tab when you touch on the search people it takes time.2gb ram what a joke its not even working like 1gb.My old redmi note 3 (2017) works greater than thisThis is so irritating.If you have budget issue, I will suggest you to buy other brand. if you want to buy only redmi then I will suggest you to don't buy any redmi phone that's falls under 10000."
Not much expected,3,  Camera quality is not much expected. Battery backup and screen size is good
Nice Phone in 2300 because i got it in a exchange of my old realme c2,3,"  Nice Phone in 2300 for me in exchange my realme c2Pros to be considered :-Camera -3.5* , nice picture in 13mp don't compare to 48 or 64 at this price i think it's better than my previous phone the photos look naturalDisplay - 4*  ,6.5 inch 720p big and nice display but could have been little brighterProcessor - 3*. The g25 is decent for daily useag but, They could have provided g35 atleast but in day to day nice performance , normal game running without any problem.Battery - 3.5* , battery life is nice can run whole day with normal and some gaming no problem but one issue they said it was 5000mah battery but if you check in any Phone information app on Google Play they show only 4100mah battery so you can check yourselfCons  to be considered:-Now there is no gyroscope or electronic compass in sensors , no or blaster ,no type c , no fingerprint sensor.In 7k i would not recommend this phone redmi 7a is much better deal or realme c3 , but since i got it in a exchange of only 2300 rupees i think it's bang for buck deal for me, but GST are increased to 18% so if you buy any 10000 phone you will pay 1800 or 2k to tex in government so smartphone prices are increased dramatically , that's why they are no longer value for money phone in smartphone market right now.Amazon service is really incredible for exchange, i try to exchange my phone through flipkart but they denied for no reason they have fraud exchange policy. But i have very nice experience with Amazon service , the delivery boy was good too ,Thanks for fantastic service Amazon.Thanks for your time and reading this long review.I will update later"
Super phone...,5,"  Phone looking is very niceBattery back up is very niceIn this price range ,this mobile is goodBut camara is not that much good but okNot coming any case along with mobile,they should have provided case.Over all mobile is very nice..."
Good,5,  Amazing product with this price
Go for it!,5,  The phone is good to give an elder person who does not need a very powerful phone. It's also gotta  large  screen that apt for reading. I say go for it as a budget phone. Gifted it to my mother... She is not the least bit tech savvy. I have not tried any heavy gaming on it so cannot say.The daylight photos are stunning and clear. Have not checked not time pictures.The charger get the phone charged pretty quick.Using it for fifteen days.Go for it!
A downgrade over Redmi 8A. Not worth it.,3,"  When you consider its predecessor the 8A/8A Dual, this one is a major downgrade. A sluggish Helio chipset, Type B charging port, an unnecessarily tall screen, bad camera all combine to deliver a not so VFM product. I am saying this coz I have the 8A Dual as well... Not impressed. With every series, there are too many compromises which is very much unlike Redmi"
Great value for money with low budget,4,  It doesn't comes with fingerprint sensor althought phone has massive battery with decent processors.charging around 2.5 hrs to complete from 0 to 95%. I didn't face any bugs right now. Made of this phone is excellent build quality and big screen added much advantage  it comes with 10w mi charger not supports fast charging.
Value for your money,3,  Value for money....Mediatec processor is bit slower.. dont expect a good cam..Frond cam was good  ...A good phone for older people who did not use much apps...6800 INR
Not so good,3,"  Camera quality is not as per the expectations, with 13 mp you get better camera quality but this phone has bad camera quality pics along with phone volume very less. Average phone i would say for regular use but doesn't justify it's specifications."
Radmi 9A,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
It sucks,1,"  Within 4 months of buying this phone, the storage was full. I didn't get even half of the 32 gb this phone bragged about. And that's all because of the useless pre-installed apps this phone comes with that no one, NO ONE, needs. I can't get rid of those stupid Xiaomi apps. This sucks. Never buying from Xiaomi again."
Good for below average users.,3,  The performance is not as good as specified in the discription. Camera parameters are good but the picture is not as good as it should be with these specifications. Overall it is good for below average users. But don't think of playing games on it as it hangs even on playing simple games like subway surfers. Battery is good and lasts about a day.
JUST A SIMPLE PRODUCT. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH,4,  To be frank it is a good product for the priceYou can't expect too much from it‚Ä¢The camera is ok type but not much features in editing the photos‚Ä¢There too many in built apps but they can be removed if not required‚Ä¢The screen is not bright at all its really dull to see‚Ä¢good delivery by amazon‚Ä¢Only good thing is that you get 3gb with 32 GB storage and a really big screen‚Ä¢It is good for people who don't expect much from their mobiles and use phones for a basic necessity‚Ä¢If you are looking for more features then I do not recommend this you have other options in this price‚Ä¢You also need to buy a cover and screen protector‚Ä¢The box only has the phone with charger and the manual with invoice of bill
Better to not to purchase MI products,1,  I am writing this review after 6 months....After 6 months phone was automatically restart & some time it will go to off mode it may takes 1 or 2 day's to  come back to on mode.... Service center guys saying bord issue but this boar was not available now....
Worth!,4,"  In this price, this is perfect smartphone for a beginner or senior citizens.**Camera quality is not good as expected. Basic front camera. Rear camera is ok.**No fingerprint scanner, but thank god Face unlock is there.****Good thing is display size and quality.üëç"
Redmi 9A 3GB RAM RS. 7499 AMAZON'S DELIVERY IS SUPERB üëç,2,"  Batteryüîãis ok, camera is worstüëé  you will receive only 20Gb approx to use rest Will be filled with Preinstalled mi apps,Amazon delivery is very fast ‚ö° but mobile quality is not upto the markGiving two ‚≠ê‚≠ê only for Amazon"
Overall good... üòç,5,"  I personally really like this smart phone at this price...  The camera quality is good... As we know the  more camera quality the more price... It is even light weight....By the way I really like it..  I recommend everyone who is finding the smartphone at that price,  he or she should bye.....But about one thing in this phone  I am disappointed,  it is the fingerprint scanner..Over all perfect even I have no words to say.. üòÄüòÖüòç..Value of money....Please click on helpful,  if you found it helpful..  Amazon service well an good .."
Great Phone at this Budget and Ultra Fast Delivery.,5,"  I really Love Redmi Phones. My First Phone was Redmi 8A. I bought this phone as a Gift for my Dad.Great offers by Amazon for this Phone. You cant Buy a Super Smartphone Like this at a Price Range of 7500 Rs - 3GB  RAM Variant anywhere in the Online World or at Retail Stores. I love the Fact that Redmi 9A is Far Lighter than Redmi 8a. I ordered the Phone on 2nd November and i Got it on 3rd November. It was not even a Complete day, as there was 2 hrs left for a day to complete. Fastest Delivery by Amazon even for a Standard Delivery Order. I would love to continue my Shopping with Amazon.You can Go for this Phone Blindly.Such a Feasible phone. Love it."
Good deal for the price offered .,4,"  Overall the mobile phone is ok for the price , should have provided fingerprint scanner which is very common now , battery life is good , camera üì∏ is somewhat ok , look is good , very good for normal user , no hesitation in recommending this product ."
its good,4,"  Purchased for my dad, used past 10 days and seems good so far. Look and feel, build, battery life is good. Features are smooth. not played any games and also not done any multi processing so not sure about performance."
Good phone,2,"  good phone for money 7500, 32gb memory, 3gb ram enough is good for normal use, hd display awesome, Played game temple run, Visualation is outstanding, quick response in touch, sound quality average. Camera portrait mode is super. Selfie camera very average.Missing futures infrared remote control, finger print sensor, lighting sensor.overall okay for the budget"
Worth for money,4,"  Writing this review after using this phone for some weeksThis phone is absolute worth for moneyBut iam not a giving a five star rating because iam ana ios lover and generally iam using ios phonesI brought this for my grandfather and by his opinion it's perfectBt i feel a problem that 3gb ram feature is only in it's boxSo if you are a game lover iam not suggesting this for you , but it's perfect for middle agedThe fingerprint sensor is fastBattery life is also goodAmd the camera quality is averge"
"Waste of Money, Worst Processor (MediaTek)",1,"  Battery is good , but mediatek processor is worst , too much hanging and slow processFor Adapter Data Cable is very short arround 1.2 feet , You need Buy One apart from this, it's a extra expense to buy a data cable.Only good thing is no heat producing on charging as well as normal usage , Battery is Superb, arround 1 full day if you are using continuousBetter go Redmi 8A DualSingle star for Redmi 9A, I wasted my money, there is no exchange options for this phone"
Review after 2 day use.,5,"  Camera quality: good image attached from both facing rear and front.Battery life : after full charge work 2 day with all the activities you can doFinger print : doesn't have finger printGlass and display : very crystal clear display but glass is not Corning gorilla.AI Face Lock: working good, some time it's not recognize."
Redmi 9a 3/32 in  not  availableFingerprint  sensor. Battery and camera Qlity Normal.,4,  Fingerprint sensor not available.battery and camera qlity  Normal .I am not proper use after used full review. Why full review not permitted .
Recommended,5,"  A very good item at this price range, bought two pieces for my kids, they loved it, they used it for playing games( Pubg,) they say it run smooth. Big battery..last whole day. Camera, sound and all other features are up to the mark."
Charger kit missing,1,  Need charger kit missing . Complained already raised . Not am issue my mobile .Am already paid temper glass and back cover . This explanation alt submit to customer care . Also my son study online class . Some education app . Already downloaded . So not possible submit to u my mobile . Need only charger kit. By krishnamoorthy .Advice to delivery person .
Nice Buy for parents,5,  I bought 2 GB Ram mobile for my parents. Its working well and surprisingly it looks slim and weight also less compare to other 5000mps battery mobiles. Big display is the game changer here. User friendly OS.For elders they dont need finger scanner . Finally satisficed with the all round impression under the price of 6200/-Average camera can not expect more at this price range at this moment.
Overall a good product in budget.,4,  I liked its processing speed which is very good. The ram is genuinely faster. Camera quality is average. Battery backup in this range is also good. The only problem with this model is that it does lack a good internet speed. I mean whatever sim card you are using this device will not give that much internet speed than what you expect. Sometimes the experience is horrible. The internet speed is very slow in this device whether you use any 4g sim. But what do you expect in this budget. It is a budgeted phone with some limitations.
Budget Friendly,3,"  Purchased this for my Mom. I don't say that this is an awesome mobile but I can tell you that at this price range it's okay to gift this to people for normal usage. Although the camera quality wasn't good at all, I was happy with the ram and storage provided at this price range.Camera Quality: 1/5Processor: 3/5Battery Life: 5/5Worth the money: 4/5"
Not at all happy with the product üòï,1,  I have ordered this Redmi 9A mobile phone as it is reasonable and compatible with my daily use as per the reviews which i got but unfortunately after owning it i have had very bad experience with the battery as it always heats up to the extreme and seems like it can explode any moment..and that too it was for the first time i have connected the charger and was shocked when it got heated up.I request the product approval team to please take a look into this issue with the product.I hope won‚Äôt be disappointed next time.Thank you!
How phone working,4,  Nice phone
- Phone hangs very frequently - Battery life is not reliable if you travel a lot.,3,  Like:- Features which exist in this price range of 6.5K -7K. Makes the phone affordable to many looking out for budget phone with an aim to use for 3 yrs.Dislike: Honest feedback from an educated & wise user.- Phone hangs very frequently (Even when space is enough nd the phone is new like 1 month)- Battery life expires in 24hrs. if you internet is on & talk continuously (I do due to my work). in 12hrs. if you watch too many online videos or listens music.
Value for money,5,  The product is awesome. Looking drop dead eye‚ù§
Nice product within the given price range!,5,"  Redmi 9A (32 GB) is a good mobile phone for those with limited budget. It has got all the nice features and functions. The screen is big, good fingerprint reader, amazing battery life, and a nice camera quality.The phone functions smoothly overall."
Cheap and best,4,"  It is worthable for this price, we can't play pubg and equal to pubg games. For online class this one much enough for the school and college students, it doesn't come with headphone,Camera quality rear is good and the front is OK for online class not for over exposure,It doesn't have finger print, screen size is bigger.I can suggest the people who is trying to buy this product.Seller send me the courier with safe and goodWe can buy it.Enjoy all!"
Best budget phone.,5,  I bought it for 5199 Rs with exchange (samsung J7) . I'm not much into camera or gaming. I bought it for daily use. Best battery life and good camera. Big screen makes watching movie great. Totally good buy for 5199 Rs.
Go for it if you have a tight budget!,4,"  1) Battery life is great!!üëåNo heating problem is found...2) Back camera is good in this price...3) While video recording with front camera i have found little bit hazy, but while taking selfie it is clear, could not understand why this is happening...4) Time taken for full charging from 20% battery life :- 2 hrs with its 10w charger5) Voice recording is very good & clear! Perfect for singers...6) A fingerprint sensor should be provided!‚òπÔ∏è7) Display is also Nice...8) Otherwise satisfied in this price..."
Decent. But worse camera,3,  Overall mob is good. They say it has 32gb storage available but when u get the mobile due to all internal apps u get only 20gb left. Never felt lag Or hang due to multie use of apps. Os quite ok. But worst thing is camera. It's almost same quality as some keypad mobile. And they have done a frod saying it's 13 mp but only 10 mp!!!!!!!!!! with badquality. And photos do not have shot on redmi. Exept camera overall decent mobile
Nice Phone at this price.,5,"  Redmi 9A is a good phone for normal use. The battery life is really encouraging. Battery lasts for almost two days even if Social medias are used. Sound quality is good, Camera is good at its level.Overall a value for money phone."
"Don't Buy,, Useless Camera,, Awesome UI",2,"  Don't Buy,, below avg Camera, for 13 MP, Its not even 2MP camera, Camera has very Low (live FP), MI WAS GOOD BUT NOW MI IS MAKING MONEY, My old MI 6 prime is better than this it has which cost 6000INR,, GO for RealMe C2,  same 13 MP camera for 7000 INR only, is Awesome... Dont Buy MI EVER they are making money now"
Good,3,  No finger print. Just below average phone. It's good for an average use. But its Worth of 7500. Good for online class. I think no other company gives 3gb ram and 32 gb memory with 5000 mah battery and fine camera quality. With 7500 rs
Wow redmi 3rd quality,1,"  This phone is looking good but working bad,very lowest quality phone.If I want search number with any alphabet in contact takes to much time ,all time slow working.So dont buy this phone .Other wise you will  realise after purchae me like because return window has close ,so I have no option.Waste my money."
Not good.,3,"  Direction sensor(magnetometer sensor)not in this phone.You can't get directionality when using maps(you will be always facing one direction.)Apart from this everything is fine for this budget.Not better than Redmi8A dual.I am satisfied with this phone because this is my secondary phone.But for thu guys who are having this as their first,you have better options if using a vouple of hundreds more."
4Star,4,  Redmi9A is really a best phone under this price but when we talk about its camera its third class and you can't buy this phone for photography purpose. Overall phone is good for normal working.
Excellent üëå,5,  My review after using it for 12 daysBest smartphone in this budgetSmartphone is very fast and smooth workingOnly defect is that the camera quality is average but at this price it's perfect
ordered on diwali sale,5,  when ordering your m-phone online you can't review cam. battery health etc.You might be wasting time.That's already available in bulk on YT.You can get detailed review of all there. Talking about order and exp. i've been ordering now since quite a while approx. mpre than 4-5years now.Delivery agent was quite polite this time.packing was excellent.product was up to the mark.every thing was good.Go for it![ amazon ]
Lovely,5,  Good product
Defective display panel,2,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†The dispaly went flickering from the moment I unpacked the phone and booted it. Disappointed and ordered a replacement. Issue didn't resolve even in multiple reeboots or taking MIUI update after first boot."
Not satisfied,2,  I ordered this phone 1 month ago in the flash sale ...that time I got that phone ..& it was written Made in India...But yesterday I received my 2nd phone.it is written Made in China...why is this? I am really confused...& My space button is not working at the time of contact saving.
Fabulous 1,5,"  Again 1 more redmi 9 series with our family. This time for our mother-in-law. We hope in first sights itself looks like made for her, simple and user friendly phone with all good feature's,,, great to go head,,,"

A great buy for Under 7k.,3,"  ""Battery life"" is great to be honest. i like the display tall, Bright. ""camera quality"" is not match any expectations. Expectations was quite average though for this price point. bloatware always been a hurdle for Mi phones.If You get it under 7K 3gigs ram go for kill.""Game performance"" was good as per the price G25 surprisingly Good processor. Overall a value for money. Ditching Fingerprint not a great option though."
Overall good performance,5,"  The one thing which every Xiaomi mobile is having is its abnormal weight compared to other mobile brand phones of similar features. The camera does not reach up to the expectation but the overall performance of the mobile phone is all ok. It has no fingerprint sensor, thus allows only face and other unlocking systems. An average person can definitely go for it if they dislike Vivo."
Even a one-star rating is more to it.,1,"  Just after 47 days of purchasing it, I got a problem with the phone. It started to reboot in a loop. Then I took it to the servicing center. The problem was resolved. I wish I could end this happily ever after. But, my happiness didn't last long. Hell! it didn't even last for 2 hours. The very next day I went to the servicing center again, the story repeats. SO I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE, as it's a waste of your time, energy, and money."
Phone,5,  The best phone üìûThis phone was good quality and camera and strogeBest priseNice phone üìû
Overpriced. Go for redmi 9i on Flipkart.,2,  Good battery life but expensive for this price tag as you can get redmi 9i at same price on Flipkart. Both mobiles are same but 9i has 4gb ram & 64gb memory.Go for Redmi 9i on flipkart.3gb ram lags a bit.
Exceptionally cool,5,"  Splendid trendy smart phone, great finish, touch sensors, display in par with more upmarket products.In a budget friendly way, suits basic function, üì∑ is good.Worth the price quoted.Thank you."
Great Mobile with all basic features perfectly matched,5,"  Excellent mobile, bought it for my mother great battery life and nice Camera for the price, My Mother makes phone calls watches YouTube and WhatsApp and she gets nearly 3 days of battery life, she is very happy, small problem is the earpiece sound is a bit low."
Nice phone,5,  Best mobile phone
Device is a pathetic,1,"  The phone quality is best but the performance isn't.The phone gets usually hang within 2 appa running in the background. You can't expect more From this device. I'm using this phone for only Calling purpose for my company sim. I have OP 7 pro for my uses, but this phone is really needs a strong software database, good camera quality, ram performance for smooth use."
Sought of Good Mobile at this price,4,"  The display of the mobile is good enough and battery life is awesome. Camera is you can say OK sought but what to expect in such a low price. A little bit hanging issue due to 2GB RAM , else otherwise everything is good. I got it for Rs.6120 (10% SBI credit Card discount) . You can go for it."

It's made in china,1,"  Don't buy this phone , it's made in China"
1 month with you another at service centre,1,"  Worst phone ever bought. After using for nearly 20 days it stopped taking charge. Service center found mother board fault & change it, after that in play store log in itself it turned off again permanently. 2nd service center visit updated the software & it started working. Now if I use it for 2-3 minutes continuously it restarts. Forget about gaming or any smartphone activity."
Not taking update,1,"  Not taking update for Google Chrome and webview system. I called up Amazon customer care, but they did not respond and behavior of customer executive was very wrost"
Average phone- serves its cost,3,"  Average phone, do not expect too much in case of performance. For first time touch pad buyers, if u have already used better configuration u won‚Äôt like it at all. This phone is to give a budgeted gift. Teenagers better put some more money and buy better one.."
Good product,4,  Quality is good in the price range below Rs 7000  battery does not last long and camera captured quality will be ok if you are looking for high quality camera or high battery back up you need to buy higher version model in higher price segment
A unbeatable budget kingü•∞,5,  Got the product today. I am so much happy with the build quality and look of the phone .No other phone have this asthetic look in this price segment.Camera quality also so good. Main attraction about this phone is its display. It's a big gorgeous HD panel in its segment.Considering all things redmi did a great jobWith 9AGO blindly with this product of your budget is 6999
Hangs a lot with a black screen and stops working,1,  Bought two phines and It's been 7 days only and both the phone starts hanging along with a black screen and then needs a restart.‡•§‡•§Worst part is I am not able to avail servicing facility by amazonAlso brand service is ignoring my complaints

You can watch 720p videoPerformance : No lag in day to day useage .Run smoothly every app.***No heating problemOverall product is good and value for money"
Average android phone,2,"  Heat problem and less battery backup, hope this will be fixed in android update."
good as a gift,4,  this product is for the people who are in search of average smartphone in an average price range. camera is a little average and it feels a little heavy probably due to its 5000Mah battery and large body but performance is good and there is no heat problem over heavy uses even. This is not for gaming purpose but i played lite games and performance was good. Overall good for general purpose.
Just Average product,3,  Its not an i was expecting. The disappointed me this time. As i come camera of redmi and other with same megepixel i found other much better than it. Battery is good you can use it full day and charger is also fast . But for very normal usage you can bought this product but if you are heavy user dont think about it. It lags sometime.
Excellent Phone at affordable price.,5,  The phone is excellent. Super fast charging. Camera is very decent. Screen is bigger than earlier versions of Redmi phone. Highly recommended.Go for it.üëçüëç
nice,5,  This product from redmi is fine under this price but the display is really bad i think so if you are willing to add some more money üí≤ then go for other product
"Terrible Face Unlock, No Fingerprint sensor",1,  1- Display quality sucks. 720p video seems like 480p.2- Cameras are terrific.3- Too much lags.4- Unstoppable Miui ads.5- Face Unlock usually takes 5-10 seconds and most of the time it doesn't work.6- No Fingerprint sensor.7- Battery is draining more quickly and fast charging is also gone after 5 months.Bottom line- Don't buy this Covid phone.
"Wrong Product, fake promises",1,"  Brought a phone only when it was written  it would be manufactured in India, but when it was delivered we got a made in China product ...... Absolutely fake promise by Amazon ...... When I initiated a replacement request there's no one to acknowledge..... Pathetic service.........!!!!!!!"
Network catching problem,4,  Phone is good. But mobile network catching problem very slowly.you tube not open in my mobile.sir I am very sad.please write down my information
Best phone of rs 6500,5,  I think it is the best phone of rs 6500 no othe company can give us so better product as redmi 9a it is very good phone for lite use but if u are a heavy user then u have to excess your range at 10000Sorry not for pubg or freefire users  but helio p25 is a good prossessor........... It also may not for a camera loveThanks for reading .............................. üôè
Budget smartphone,5,"  One o the budget smartphone in the market1. Long battery life2. Fingerprint reader is nice and smooth3. Good for old age peole like parents and grand parents because it is economic and also a smartphone as well .4. According to price it is enough to hold all the features like others smartphone have like battery, camera and others .In my opinion go for it ."
Made in china,1,"  Made in china, build quality bad, speaker also not good...pls go with redmi 9 or redmi 9 prime made in india version"
Good product for the price but could be better if included a back cover & screen guard,4,  Overall good product nominal peformance for daily tasks but not at all suggested for multitasking or gaming or photography coz AF its a budget phone so just fits right with the regular flow. No back cover & screen guard & takes lot of time to charge
Bada display bada battery bada camera üî•üî•üî•,5,  Wow üò≤ I am surprised up features of this maobile awesome products mi India big display big battery and camera also good I recommend all of you üòâ‚ò∫Ô∏èüíó
Worst ever I seen.,1,"  Camera quality is not good,touch screen behaves unintended input when you make call by close by ear.Flash Light seems low power.Face locking system is not much better as expectation.No Magnetic Sensor, so you can't use compass feature or app.Some of bluetooth headset v5 doesn't works.*** I will suggest better to go for another ****"
Ok phone but as per price & performance its a little high priced,3,  Frequent call drops happen. Good screen etc & camera quality but battery is not that good especially if you have you are connected to data or wifi most times. Most annoying is the call drops & you have to redial & connect.Overall an OK phone which could have been priced lower with the quality it possesses
Don't purchase this.Go for any other phone .,1,"  The processor is extremely slow , even can't process Chrome browser efficiently .Absolute waste of money ,choppy apps.Camera is a disaster with lot of noise and poor light sensing technologyHigh contrast is visible in photos.Poor quality at low light .Don't purchase thisIf you r still here ,that proves u r dumb to think about purchasing this."
Worth buyable under this price.,4,"  Ordered nature green coloured mobile, Amazon delivered in 2 days. Colour is slightly different (dark) than what is visible on site. Battery performance is superb and processor performance is upto the mark. Indoor pics are not good with its camera."
Good budget phone for students studying online @home,5,  Bought this for someone else whose kids needed a phone with good Wi-Fi connectivity for online studies.Working Gr8 for him!Battery life is quite good..
Phone started rebooting not good,2,"  Phone started rebooting n files got corrupted.In 9 days only, I have to take it to service center.Software needs proper handle of corruption"

Made in China,2,  The product is made in China and how mi is selling in India after the ban of Chinese phones in India.
worst mobile,1,"  Worst mobile ever, primary function of mobile is calling yet this mobile showing unique problem that on calling fellow person doesnt hear voice at all. as well service centre not able to solve problem. worst camera quality ever."
Good entry level device,4,"  I was looking for an entry level budget phone with latest features, this device serves the purpose, natural green color is awesome.  Beware, the device comes with 'Made in China' label."
Not buy 2gb ram,3,  The built quality is good not great if you are buying this please by the 3gb variant which gives more value of you by GB variant it will lag under 2 months
"Entry level, Value for money,",4,"  Battery life is good after use of intense calls, internet and video lasting for 3 days. Camera quality is good for entry level user. Value for money. So far not use for gaming."
Value for old exchange mobile,5,  Good! as purchased this mobile in exchange offer which is the best in deal. Good battery life. Good picture quality. Overall my experience is 10 out of 10. Thanks amazon for this wonderful exchange offer.
After using one month 9A,4,"  It is fully budget phone for mostly aged people to user smart phone, with low cost and high performance.If you want to use for long term and less use of apps and gaming then go for this 9A which is having good battery backup big screen with 3 GB ram etc."
Below average phone,2,"  It is very slow, lags a lot and hangs occasionally. It gets heated up if you use internet for long. No Gorilla glass, no fingerprint sensor, battery backup is good and camera is ok. Big screen with average display and Sound is a bit low. Dual apps and split screen function is missing. Its a low budget phone from Redmi. Go for better options"
Phone is slow,1,"  I found the phone a bit slow and lags in certain areas. Previously, I was using redmi 7a, 2Gb so I thought this phone might a good upgrade. But disappointed."
"Phone for people who uses Youtube, Whatsapp and for calls.",4,"  The product is decent in the price range. If you use the phone moderately only for calls, youtube or WhatsApp, then this is the best phone. I bought it for my mother and she felt happy, The screen is big and the battery is also good only if you use it moderately. Bought it for 6200 rupees."
Mobail so good and camera quality,5,"  Mobail so good and camera quality osm and battrary is so good, fingerprint one touch finger"
Not a good option,1,  1- Mobile is very slow. Skype app buttons response in 15 seconds.2- Touch of mobile is really bad.3- camera is also very poor.4- this mobiles comes with customised os. Which includes lot of third party apps which makes this mobile slow.5- finger or biomateic is not available.
Nice screen,5,  Battery life is good. I've been using it for 2 months now and it's great. It handles all social media apps very well and the calling audio quality is very good.
Terrible phone. Not even value for money.,1,  There is no magnetometer or gyroscope. Compasses wont work and even google map wont show which direction i am facing accurately. I bought it and regretted my purchase within the hour. No value at all for me. There is a lot of false advertising in other review websites which prompted me to get this.
Worth buy,5,  If you want to purchase a mobile under 6.8k it will be a better one. Giant display at 6.8k. Massive battery backup. Bought the mobile for Rs.6120 in great indian festival.
Slow as snail,2,  The phone is super slow. If one is navigating from one app to another it takes 5-6 second to open.If you open chrome it takes 10 second to open.Camera quality is not good (though the expectations from camera was not much).
9a mobile is good another,5,  Premium look..
Think twice.,3,"  Display and camera quality are too poor, else phone is ok, so it's better to spend few more buck for a better experience. However phone is good for new users."
Good From Xiaomi!,5,  Got this for 6400‚Çπ during the sale and feels like it satisfies the price paid for the device! Good product from Xiaomi! Go for it
POOR QUALITY MOBILE,3,"  I have been using the redmi 9A mobile for 7 months. Atfirst I think it will be good mobile, but now it seemed not good. Its scrolling is not smooth, sometimes it hangs, it shows full network signal but doesn't give net speed and even youtube doesn't continue smoothly. I don't play any online games like freefire or others. Camera isn't good. Only one thing is its battery is good."
WiFi hotspot doesn't connect to Laptop,3,"  Handset is fine for daily usage, video calling, zoom meeting etc. But the biggest drawback is its WiFi hotspot doesn't get connected to Laptop. I had tried several troubleshooting but nothing has worked. Really disappointed with this as I need to work on my laptop with internet on."
Not a Good Handset in,2,"  Not a good handset, its very slow and camera quality is not good. It had purchased it for my dad. Sold it back on olx after 1 month. The only best thing is battery. Charges quickly and runs long"

Not worth for money,1,"  Camera quality is poor, battery life is better. Don't get fooled by the average ratings. Never go for this. Go for some other phones at this rate please read reviews in another site before buying this phone.  Posting the review for third time. Hope this will get posted this time."
Too slow....not worth it...,1,"  Camera quality is not so good, initially I thought phone is nice. However, after using this, m so frustrated and it's too slow. It's a waste of money. Don't buy this. Once again telling, it's very very slow..... please don't refer my previous comment"

Super smartphone for older people (brilliant beginners phone)......,4,"  Decent phone for this price range. But I am not recommend this phone to any youngster who is approaching this phone with an intention to play games. If battery, decent camera (with gcam) are your  main concern then go for it.

Worth the price,4,  The handset is good1. Great battery life.2. Display has good pixels.3. Screen is big.4. Ram speed is very fast.5. Camera quality is so so.6. Network hold a lot
Not upto the mark,2,"  It takes nearly 3 hrs to charge fully. And battery draining quickly, though they mention duration hrs as 2 days. Camera quality is ok not that much. And while charging mobile is heat up as I kept in fire.specifications seems to be awesome but disappointed with its working condition. We cannot spend 7k often with these issues."

It doesn't have fm radio n gorilla glass protection overall it is a budget smart phone at 7500.Go for this"
Good phone,5,  I tried for 3 GB RAM phone but unfortunately got only the 2 GB one. Memory is the only one constrain noticed.
Long term review,3,  Happy with EMI option as it made the purchase affordable.Thanks Amazon.Product is good value.Would have liked a hard case to be bundled.The Micro USB charging port is cumbersome(User is a Senior Citizen)Would have preferred a non Chinese brand.

Best mobile phone in that price range,4,  Great phone at that price point. Other leading brands do not offer these specs in that price range. Well built and really lightweight phone. Love the color though. Long battery life. Great for kids to attend online classes.
"Value for money,",5,"  Overall good product at this price point, Xiomi claiming made in India product, but we received made in China, I had never thought that I will get made in China product. It's very disappointing for me, Amazon delivering most of product  made in China."

Very bad product,1,  Product is very bad. Mobile is heating up very much and screen colour changes after using it for ten days. Some heat waves comes out from the mobile. First time I received such a bad product from Amazon.
Nice phone.,5,"  The phone has a good battery backup (normal use) and nice design.The camera is okay. One problem that I noticed is that: the system apps use internet even the data is disabled. So, I have disabled the mobile data for all apps to avoid losing balance(since no data pack is active in that SIM)."
Decent Phone for a Decent Price,4,  There will always be Pros and Cons even if you buy a lac phone but for this price it justifies the quality and features fairly
"Long battery life, great functionality and fast",4,"  Good, easy to use, functional phone with good speed and apps. I need to charge only twice a week which is awesome. The camera quality is just average or a bit under but that is not why I bought this phone. Other than the picture/video qlty, everything else is awesome. Great value for money."
Good colour and designed,5,  It's battery life and memory are remarkable. It's a great experience to use a redmi phone in this price. It's really a great product
Worth the price!,4,"  Thank you Amazon for delivering the product superfast. The Redmi 9A mobile is worth the price. Not much expectations from the range yet it functions optimum. Good battery, smooth operation, easy AI response for camera and good processing speed."

Best Phone in 7K price range!,5,"  If you ask for one word to describe Redmi 9A it is 'smooth'. It functions effortlessly with 3GB RAM, and every feature sails without nay trouble. Camera is the only con, but how much can one expect in this price range. Well done, Redmi."
Nice phone in this budget,4,  Battery is very very good and other features is also very good in this price. Only negative thing in this phone is weight
Value for money,2,  Value for money but it goes to hanging mode many times.  Had to update the Android.  After that it started working well but it keeps happening. That is irritating.
Camera is cheap n worst but average  phone is good,3,"  With camera not happy, another brand in this range gives good AVG camera ,but all avg it is working well ,writing this after using this phone for 3 months"
Value for money,4,  Due to 2GB ram and pre installed redmi apps the phone is bit laggy but as per price and brand its good. Go for nature green colour its awesome!
Probably the best we can get in this price range,5,"  Got it for my mom, she uses it for over 8h at a stretch, and still has quite a battery life. Redmi has been improving monstrously. The camera quality is so so, but we don't aim for professional photography with it so doesn't bother, performance wise it's the best in this price range"
overall good experience,3,  what do you expect in this price range?. mi has bundled pretty much everything in it. plus blue is also my favourite color so if you are planning to buy it just go for it. good phone at this price range.
Go For It. üôÉ,4,  Truth about this PhonePros:1. Amazing Battery life.2. Decent Camera.3. Android 10.4. Big Screen.5. Sexy look.6. Low price.7. Dedicated Micro Sim Slot.cons:Nothing as the price rage is low. You can not get everything in this price.

BUDGET PHONE,4,"  Product seems genuine. Battery backup as of 4 days seems excellent.Hassle free performance, except for lagging and heating issue at times. Perfect fit for this budget , especially if you are planning to get it for someone who has never used a smartphone, as it's very much user friendly."
Price should be less,3,  Ok product overall. Camera is not upto the mark. Good display. Average sound quality. Body color is slightly different from shown in the ad. I think price should be below 7k

Not expected this,1,  I ordered this phone for first time. But 2 gb ram is not sufficient for lagre apps but it can be used for low size apps. Not many apps can be used at a time. Camera is decent.I hate adds which comes whenever we install apps.
Best phone for this price segment,5,  This is the only phone for this price segment and a best suggestion my me. The camera quality is decent and not bad at night any how its worth for the money paid. As provoed big display and dot notch are great for this price and I appreciate it. The power back up with 5000mah is good.
Budget friendly phone under 7.5K bracket,5,"  For a Mid tier phone, it packs every feature that you can except for a phone. The phone does not have a fingerprint sensor given the price it is acceptable. Have a good battery life.So far so good."

Nice phone,5,  Redmi is reputed brand with economic price so worth to buy this phone. This phone is perfect for my child for online study. all working good. thanks to amazon.
Mobile processor slow,3,  Mobile overlay ok not good. Network capacity is poor .frequently net disconnect. Mediatek helio processor is not good than snapdragon.
Pathetic service,1,"  Amazon promised to replace it as it had error which their technician approved too, but no-one really cared to replace it even after a month and several requests. I am going to think thrice before ordering expensive stuff from here."
"Issue with the charger, rest everything is awesome.",4,  The phone is very nice in condition but it seems like the charger that I received is not of this phone as it is disconnecting again and again and that is why I'm unable to charge my phone.

This phone is goodüëçunder this price 7.5k....,4,  Nice color and style as of now working fine no hang or sound loud but charger is slow.Network connectivity is also strong .......and camera quality is not good but it's ok at this affordable price....Go for it if you have budget of under 8k.

Problem not happy,1,  Problem im not happy
Don't buy this phone,1,  Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
One of the good choice for low budget phone,4,  If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
Bad camera and made in China,1,  Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
Simply excellent. Read complete review written after my 30 days of experience,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
Amezing One,5,"  If I started to rating it's all features, it will as followed (Out of 5 üåü):Processor ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êDisplay ‚≠ê ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êBattery ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êSound in loud ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êSound in 3.5 mm cord ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êCamera Selfie ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êCamera Back ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êNetworking ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êLack:There is no Fingers print sensor locked.There is no Back cover in the box.Camera quality not so good."
Value-For-Money & Recommended for a normal user,4,"  I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
Poor,1,  Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
Dont buy it as lower model is good then this,3,"  Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
BUDGET WORTHY PHONE,5,  Nice phone.. overall performance is just amazing
Poor processor basic UI also lagging,3,"  COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"
Compass is not working,1,"  Compass is not working, showing error as required sensor are not available,And everything is fine."
Please..... üôè don't Buy. Cheapest product from MiüëéDon't Believe in Paid Adverstiment,1,"  Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. üòû. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone üì±, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% üòÄ. The phone is too lightweight ‚ò∫Ô∏è and very handyüòÑ Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. üòÉ.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. üò≠GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. üò†üò†.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. üò•. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good üëçBut it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. üò†Display quality is too poor. üò´ Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. ü•∫  No led in front of the display.üò∞Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection üò•If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or aboveü§ó with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."

Redme 9A,3,  No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
Best under budget phone,5,  Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
Smooth and satisfying,5,"  Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
Good but not up to the mark,3,  Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
Awesome loved it,5,  It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
Excellent phone,5,"  Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
Stopüî¥üî¥üî¥,2,  Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
Cons and Pros,3,"  This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ‚ô•Ô∏è no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
Goooooooood,3,  Weary good product  very fast delivery
Points to be noted,3,"  Points to be noted:üëâ The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.üëâ This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.üëâ Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.üëâ Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.üëâ After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
Made in china,2,  Phone is good. But it is made in China
Best phone for PARENTS. 5/5 for Rs.6800,5,"  Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
Best in this price range,5,  Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
Wow,5,  Wow
Very worst,1,"  I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available.

I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
Good,4,"  Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
Screen resolution is not good & worst camera ever.. rest so so..,2,  Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
Value for money or not?,4,"  So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5‚≠ê for thatPros-‚Ä¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this range‚Ä¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.‚Ä¢Good for basic usage.‚Ä¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:‚Ä¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)‚Ä¢Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"
Average,3,  A little bit slow..I think it will more lagged afterwards..Big screen.Camera is not good.. As well as selfie..Ph is For normal users..
Not up to the mark,1,  Not satisfied. No camera perfection. No finger sensor. Perfect China piece. Cheap and worst. Started hanging.

"Waste of money, Worst customer service.",1,"  I am never going to buy any electronic product from amazon anymore. Experienced worst customer service. Product is not upto the mark. Over heating, network connectivity issue was there. They were using their aaps to dignose in which everything will be showing normal. The same aap can not be used in any other phones for checking. That means this aap is specifically designed by amazone for amazon bought mobiles. You will never know if this is correct or not. Based upon that refund/ replancement will not be done. Amozon update your customer service otherwise if customers make you customers can also break you. After 2 days of continuos chasing no result. Wasted Rs 7498/-."

Good price product,4,  Good product
Not recommended and a cheating,1,"  Amazon is now becomes a cheater, there is no way to return the item..it has below shortcomings..Poor Camera quality, though it has feature for Portrait and Landscape but in landscape mode the clicked pictures are blurred...Poor battery performance, the 5000mAh battery is so poor that it significantly heats up entire phone within  2-5 minutes and drains the battery. Weight is also quite more.I tried to return the item, it says have a test with some software or talk to technical team (after uploading no. of things, very tedious), there are many sites in which you can have hassle free return...You will get frustrated and defiantly could not be able to return the item..there is no way to interact on email and call..so select the items very very carefully..otherwise they are sitting there to cheat your hard earned money...be careful.."

"VoLte, VoWifi Not working!!",1,"  With Airtel Sim, neither VoLte and VoWifi are working in my phone. Airtel Thanks app is showing your handset is 4G but not VoLte compatible. Same thing in Vodafone. Is anyone else having this issue? Asked for replacement. Let's see what amazon do with this issue!Update: After my complaint, Amazon replaced my phone with a brand new piece. But the same issue happened with it also. So again I complained and I am so thankful to Amazon that they took my phone back and told me that they will refund my money. Phone was taken back, just waiting for my refund now.If you have a Jio sim, just go for it. It is an awesome phone but If you are Airtel or Vi customer then there will be some issue with VoLte and VoWifi."

We buyers must also do our homework before buying a high-tech product.,1,"  I want to share a live (semi-positive) experience with Amazon a week back. I purchased a Redmi 9A phone for my grandson on 21 Dec. The phone came on 24th, but wouldn't boot. I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't bootü•µAnother round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN üò¢üò¢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day‚ùóMoral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier üôè"
China DESH KA PHONE......,3,"  Why do you advertise this phone as DESH KA SMARTPHONE. Did you know, What is the meaning of DESH?. I thought of buying a phone by made in India. But Amazon delivered to me a phone by made in China. Not just the phone, the charger and charging cable are made in China!. If we buy a smartphone at a discount, will you behave substandard manner?"

Video Audio quality.,4,"  Phone is good and battery backup is very nice,working long time. But one thing i faced that i bought on first sale i found one problem that video recording audio not good very low hearing then i returned that one and get change  with new. After getting new one i found that problem is same and that not problem its phone problem. Phone video recording audio is very low compare to others phone. I can't hear clear voice in even low distance recording."
Best for Average usage.,5,"  Overall mobile is good for an average usage. Its camera, audio quality is average to good. Its performance is very good because of good internal storage.Handy as well as the screen is quite wide and provides good viewing angle.Plus point is its battery which is quite huge. Has microusb slot and charger is of 10W thats why charging might be somewhat slow (not that fast)If you want the mobile for an average usage then this can be a best deal for you.I got this 2gb Ram 32gb Rom varient in 6800 Rs.Or if your usage is high i would recommend to go for some other Redmi products for price beyond 8000 to 9000.Below 7000 this product gives satisfactory performance."
Leaves a sour taste,1,"  Pros:1. Performance is Ok, for the price.2. 2 SIM + 1 Micro SD Card Slot, i.e. no hybrid slotsCons:1. Too many advertisements and installs 3rd party apps forcefully. This is not mentioned in the listing. This should be made mandatory. But thankfully practically almost everything can be uninstalled.2. Micro USB port for charging is unacceptable in 20213. Used a MIUI based phone long time ago, somehow I feel it has become much worse and confusing. Even changing your notification sound or ringtone takes some effort and a little bit of scratching your head. They should include a manual LOL."
Very Nice budget phone.,5,"  Ordered Redmi 9A 3GB 32GB version, sky blue for my mother 2 days ago. Delivery was quick. The delivery guy also opened the package on request for assurance. Got the product as ordered.Initial impressions:Pros:Large screen, Nice color, good processor, ample RAM for daily normal user, good battery backup, drains very gradually even if you are on calls whole day. Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions. (Very good in daylight or external use.)One of the best phones available in the market at this price. I have given it 5 star for specifications in this price range. I ordered it with an offer.. More than what you can get from any other Indian brand in 7000 rs."
"Very Fast, Superb Video Calling Clarity",5,"  I was using iPhone 6s Plus and when I got this phone for Rs. 7,500, I was surprised ! It have more display clarity and camera clarity than my iPhone. Also it is as fast as my iPhone. Mi have combined All features of ios and Android in this Phone, that make this phone special compared to other Android Phones. Its OS is Mi modified version of Android. The modified version is very intelligent and smart. It have removed all the disadvantages of Android Phones. It have iPhone features like Face unlock, time lapse video, burst mode and exposure increase and decrese in camera etc.Sound clarity also superb.My Brother in the US have amazed to see the better clarity of video calling than my previos iPhone."

Basic android smartphone,5,"  A basic android smartphone for basic android experience. If you're looking for an entry level smartphone with android os then this is a phone for you. This model packs a 3gb ram and 32gb internal storage which is more than sufficient for your daily needs from Facebook to YouTube and anything in between.

"Most pathetic product - BE warned - DO NOT BUY !!! Battery, Memory and Bandwidth hogging phone.",1,"  This is the most pathetic product that I have ever had the misfortune to buy on Amazon - and you cannot return the product and hope to exchange it for something else because they do not permit ""RETURNS"" only ""REPLACEMENT""  - WITH THE SAME GODFORESAKEN PHONE!!!!!""It comes preloaded with MIUI and other inefficient memory, bandwidth  and battery draining bloatware and constant advertisements all over the place  - and there is no way you can disable them - by buying this phone you are compromising your data and security and paying for an advertiser to constantly bombard you with adverts for thoroughly useless products -  and you have to pay for the bandwidth he uses up.In an attempt to get rid of MIUI you cannot even flash a custom ROM like LineageOS or some of the other AltROMs cause the manufacturers of the device will not share the code. SO IF YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS DEVICE YOU ARE STUCK.Do not buy - if you happen to have paid for it then your fate is sealed - you cannot hope for a refund ---- better to spend that money on buying some cow dung - might help make a cow happy!"
Nice Phone for doing normal works,3,"  This phone is helpful in basic things, camera quality is not good at all, specially rear camera is not good it is really a 8mp camera but Redmi is saying it 12 or 13 MP...making fool to customers. Overall it is good for taking online classes, making calls, using whatsapp but not for gaming, you can play normal games but if you play games like free fire, it starts heating and lagging. Battery is actually 4800 mAh.."
"Durable phone, worth every single rupee!",5,"  I ordered the phone during amazon 1-month deepawali sale, when it was selling for Rs 6,800. I exchanged my old Redmi phone and got further Rs 3,600 off. Plus I made the purchase using HDFC Bank credit card and got 10% cashback. Net net, i got the phone for Rs 3,150.But buying the phone at a cheap price wasn't the highlight. Its performance has not disappointed me.The features have upgraded and the Redmi-9A offers more bang for the buck. Features are intuitive and easy to use. My contact list was restored in no time.The 13MP camera is really good and, in my opinion, as good as an iPhone. I am exploring the phone's features and it has been a pleasant experience for me.If you are looking to upgrade your phone then PLEASE DON'T LOOK FURTHER!Rajagopalan VBengaluru"
Worth for the money,5,  Worth for the money.. I dont see similar features in other brand for this price range. My parents liked it very much... Wish they added some headphones to this. The color really pop's I was little hesitant while ordering about the color. But it's beautiful üòçüòçüòç
DEFECTIVE PRODUCT RECEIVED,1,"  The bad news was that I received a defective piece (what I feared the most because many customers posted review about defect). The good news was that my refund was processed on the same day as I filed the complaint with picture proof as attached here as well and I received the refund amount within 3 days.Plus, there were these black parallel horizontal lines on the screen, which I just couldn't understand why it was there. The phone looked pretty good (colour and built wise). Maybe would have been a nice one if I hadn't received a defective product."
JUST GO FOR IT.. ü§©,5,"  Amazing phone in such a low price.Great don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick face recognition, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have dual Or tripple cameras because its single camera beats most of the dual and triple camera phones, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick and last thing don't think like its cheap so obviously it will have poor looks and downgraded, no in this phone this isn't the case. Overall I'll give full stars and attaching some samples which have been slightly edited with In built editor.."
Excellent Price!,4,"  I bought this phone in the sale for a ridiculously low price. Firstly if you are someone who uses a lot of apps then this phone is not for you. It is a basic android phone which can be used for photos, WhatsApp and a few others. For the price, one shouldn't expect more. If you load a lot of apps expect the phone to go slow.The build quality was surprisingly excellent and the call quality was also good. Watching videos was also good.Frankly, for this price, I cannot complain about anything.Excellent buy in my opinion."
A good exchange offer,4,"  Pros. 1. This was bought on exchange offer, and I got a good price for my old phone. The exchange was smooth and there were no issues. Was very happy with the transaction.2. I have had it for just two weeks. So I cannot comment on durability, etc. No problem so far. Everything is as described on the Amazon page.3. The phone looks good and I am happy with the purchase.Cons.  Because it was an exchange transaction, the phone was not delivered as fast as for a full cash transaction. I ordered on 25 January and got the phone on 6 February. But I was kept updated about possible delivery dates, etc. So I was not worried.All in all, well worth it."
Good product,4,  The product is good in this price range and as a xiaomi lover you can buy it
Cheap phone with lots of incorrect details,2,  The camera provided in the phone is not  13mp at all.Picture quality is not good and it does not reflect the true colors.its ok that it is a cheap phone but atleast they should mention the correct configuration. If you compare camera picture quality with nokia phones I must say that 2mp camera in nokia made phones have better picture quality that 13mp of this phone. Its OK that this is vewry cheap phone but customer should not think that they will get a 13mp camera. Samsung or nokia make phones with 8mp camera might have better picture quality.rest i can write once i use this phone for a month.
Good and affordable,5,  Very cool phone at this price and camera is average but overall I would recommend choose Redmond over realme
An attractive deal and a reliable phone,4,"  I bought this phone on the amazon prime sale. It was a great deal will a of discounts and I was able to buy it for under ‚Çπ9,000. I've been using this phone for almost a month now and here are my feedbacks.Firstly the good points. Very sleek, good screen size and the menus are user friendly. It has face unlock, pattern and pin unlock as well but no biometric. I can't be asking for more features for this price. 2 sim trays and one SD card tray which is great. I had been using both sim trays form this phone.Now for the bad points. I'm not able to set 2 different ring tones for each sim. So when a call comes in you can only tell by looking at the screen showing on which sim I am getting the call. Next, Screen brightness is not that great. On a bright sunny day, its sometimes not bright enough even if you turn brightness to the highest. Hotspot works fine but you cannot see how many devices are connected. Moreover, you also cannot see which device is connected. Then there are those unwanted, useless Mi apps that comes standard in the phones that send you notifications to upgrade and install even though those apps have not been updated by me.These are the major points. Apart from this, there seems to be no other issues. For a secondary phone this phone is great. Value for money."
Upgraded version of Basic Mobile,2,"  In the name of ""Budget"" phones, quality and features of the mobile is compromised. The camera quality is very poor. Adding to it, the mobile is full of bloatware which reduces the speed of the mobile. Most irritating is ads everywhere - In music, App explorer, Homescreen, in lock mode, wallpaper. You name it and there is an add"
Good quality under budget,4,"  Good product for budget price rangeBut camera quality is average otherwise, value for money  product"
Good,5,"  Happy to buy this good mobile , but little bit specs missing but value for money"
Worst experience,1,  Worst mobile within 10 days we got sound problem. Whatever I am playing no sound at all. After 10 days no return policy.
Dublicate product,1,  One of the Cheapest Chinese product in this category again. It is mentioned as 5000 mah battery in the specification but actually it is not upto the mark. Actually I bought this phone for my father as it has a bigger battery. But it drains automatically within 2 days when there is no usage. But redmi 8A which I am using presently is much better product when compared to this product.I don't know whether XIOMI is prescribing wrong speciation or AMAZON is selling a dublicate product. But my suggestion is don't buy this product even when you have little usage.

Decent product for its price!,4,"  Best choice for low budget.BATTERY:It is upto use. If you use light apps and its normal function battery last upto 5-6 hours approx.#Using heavy apps(games) definately hange the device and heat it up.CAMERA:Looking at its price camera is decent . Quality is not too good, but can capture your precious moments at a decent quality.WEIGHT:Weight is light easy to handle .Looks nice.VIDEO QUALITY:The experience is not that hd  but gives you a nice experience. Sound quality is also good.It doesn't have fingerprint sensor , there is no back cover."
For the price it is ok..,3,  A good phone for the price.Seems little bit lagging. Back camera good but front camera pathetic. Not good for elderly people because bit bulky.Display is ok. Some of the apps like Google nearby sharing and files go app file sharing is not working.For the price range it is ok..Auto display brightness is crappy..
Overall good phone for daily use but go for 3gb variant.,4,"  Phone is good those who want a decent phone for daily use but first of all turn off all annoying ads they provide. No doubt on built quality, it is solid, durable. Battery life is very good. Camera gets the job done for daily use. I have 2gb variant which I won't recommend for others because I can feel slight lag if 4 apps are in the background, Go for Poco C3 3gb variant as it is the same brand of Mi,also it has better processer n u get 500rs discount on HDFC debit card. I trust Mi for long term use, I never had bad experience. Thumbs up if you find this helpful."
Good in use,4,  Smart use
"Camera poor quality,Hang",1,"  Worst packaging,Camera poor quality,mobile hanging while opening apps in it.Product is little bit ok."
Purchased the 3GB/32GB Nature Green Redmi 9A at Rs. 7499,4,  Purchased the Nature Green colour case on 23 Feb 2021 and was delivered on 25 Feb 2021. I've used it for a good couple of weeks and reviewing this purchase on 09 March 2021.It's value for money. The Camera quality is good and battery life is long as well.Actually I've placed another order for the Sea Blue colour one today.I also purchased mobile case and tempered glass with this purchase. below are the detailsBracevor Hybrid Back Cover Kickstand Case for Xiaomi Mi Redmi 9A and JGD PRODUCTS¬Æ Tempered Glass for Redmi 9A-Edge to Edge Full Screen Coverage.
Pathetic Phone,1,"  Product is below average. This is third Mi phone that I bought and all the three have had network (card) problems. Camera clarity is good but takes 10 sec to launch.. again, poor experience. Battery is good, but compared to other phones in this range, it take double the time to charge... hence the fast charging option too is not at par.Overall A very poor experience with Mi phones. I'll never buy Mi phone in future and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE."
Don't Buy This!!!,3,"  I ordered this phone day after today and it has been delivered to me. I did not like this phone at all because this phone heats up quickly and the sound of the phone speaker is also very low. Therefore, I would suggest that you spend more than 2000 rupees. And buy other smartphones of Realme.But in this MRP it is good"
Fantastic Smartphone .....,5,  Good Smartphone in low budget lover for normal use.I gifted to my wife and she is very happy with phone and it's colors.I received within 4 days.Redmi needs to price 7000 with fingerprint function.Thanks
Good inexpensive phone,3,"  It comes with 2GB of RAM. The Redmi 9A runs Android 10 and is powered by a 5000mAh non-removable battery. The Redmi 9A supports proprietary fast charging. As far as the cameras are concerned, the Redmi 9A on the rear packs a 13-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture.Redmi 9A is not the best choice when choosing an inexpensive smartphone. It got a lot of flaws. On the positive side of Redmi 9A, there are high-quality assembly and materials of use. Also, the screen size is larger, decent battery life"
Good and worth it.,4,"  Got delivered on time. Best budget level phone. Has good outer body design with attractive colour.Specs are good and user interface is smooth and lag free.Cameras are okay, not great. Yes it has a AI mode for better usage.Gets warm while using but no heating issue. Came with 55% battery charge.Overall a good buy in this price range."
Overall good product,3,  Battery quality superb at this rate .long lasting.camera quality is not good as I thought.average camera.display is perfect. Not useable for gamers.aged people can use.overall good phone.kindly press the helpful button
Good mobile at 7k range,4,"  I bought this mobile to use it for calling purpose ,just needed an extra mobile for me. It comes with 3 gb ram and 32 gb hd., Which is suffice to me. Its a good phone for basic necessities like calling, browsing and apps, not a good camera, no fingerprint reader, battery life is good, charging is fast. It's a value for money if you looking at a mobile with 7k range with big screen size and 3 gb ram."
Don't Purchase this product...,1,  Issue started within 10 days of purchase of this product. My phone doesn't charge inspite keeping in charging for 2 hours.Amazon gave us 07 days replacement but the issue started on 10th day. Spoken to the team denied replacement of the product told us to go redmi service gallery for any issue. Now have to keep all my work aside and have to run behind the gallery people to get my phone repaired..Highly disappointed with the services from Amazon ..Worst Worst Product Don't buy people...

My previous phone redmi 7A was much better.Pros:Superb battery lifeBig screen (useful for browsing)Sturdy phone, has fallen a few times, nothing brokeConsDisplay resolution is badCamera is patheticHangs very often , when switching between apps"
Beaware!!!,5,"  In description, mention that the mobile is manufacturing by Rising Stars Mobile india pvt. Ltd., that is India, But see the picture, there mention Made in China.As per my coversation with Amazon as follows:1. Firstly they say...the batch or the lot which you have received possibly it's a old one.Me: how is this possible, after lunch, i purchase this phone on 2nd sale. How it could be old one.2. Amazon: From now onward the same product we are providing to our customers it's ""manufacturing in India"" this information is mentioned on the box itself.Me: what is this means, from now onward...Means previously manufactured in china or actual manufactured in china, there after comes to india and just replace the sticker.How is possible, a product made in India and print on that item other country name.I think they make people to fool and make money, just writing MADE IN INDIA.I request to you also, those are purchased this item please check the truth.And lastly this is possible on mobile/ any other products, those we cheated by amazon."
GOOD BUDGET PHONE,4,"  Redmi 9A is one of the most affordable smartphone by Redmi. It is available in two variants of 2GB + 32GB model priced at Rs. 6,799, while the 3GB + 32GB variant carries a price tag of Rs. 7,499.I Purchased on 23rd Sep.20.l expect it will be good. It is in great  demand. I think it's a good budget  Phone."
Very bad,1,  I hope these reviw help those who want to buy it is not good pohne at all as it hangups a lot for daily usade event the pohne also does not ha a type c which is downgraded. If you want to take these pohne it is bad opt even the delivery services also sucks and very bad service from amazon even i dont want to give single star also
Front camera is very disappointing during nightlights.,3,"  Overall it is a very budget phone.In 6799 it is offering 6.5 inch screen. Screen is good and HD. I don't expect much from this phone as I have gifted it to my wife,so no need of high end multitasking and speed performance but its front camera is very disappointing during night. It shows very blurry pictures in night. The dot dots are very much visible while taking pictures at night, just like a classic phone cameras of 2005 2010. I have used many MI phones ,the cameras was upto the mark,but this time its very disappointing.I was so disappointed with the camera that I ordered replacement but I cancelled it soon for not taking the headache of setting up the phone again. I think it wasn't the single piece defect. There's a degraded quality front camera in redmi 9A. In daytime there's no issue but it is not meant for pictures in nightlights."
Worst,1,  This is hanging a lot and they don't return it ..... Just replace the product worst phone don't go for it
Too Good to Handle in Daily life,5,  thanks Amazon for so good product at best price in the marketphone is very big size screen and 3 GB RAM is totally smooth function to operatecamera is too good and quality is goodall the functions are working properly and the best thing is that it has very nice grip in the back side
Hanging,1,"  Believe the review its hang much.Even in the calling tab when you touch on the search people it takes time.2gb ram what a joke its not even working like 1gb.My old redmi note 3 (2017) works greater than thisThis is so irritating.If you have budget issue, I will suggest you to buy other brand. if you want to buy only redmi then I will suggest you to don't buy any redmi phone that's falls under 10000."
Not much expected,3,  Camera quality is not much expected. Battery backup and screen size is good
Nice Phone in 2300 because i got it in a exchange of my old realme c2,3,"  Nice Phone in 2300 for me in exchange my realme c2Pros to be considered :-Camera -3.5* , nice picture in 13mp don't compare to 48 or 64 at this price i think it's better than my previous phone the photos look naturalDisplay - 4*  ,6.5 inch 720p big and nice display but could have been little brighterProcessor - 3*. The g25 is decent for daily useag but, They could have provided g35 atleast but in day to day nice performance , normal game running without any problem.Battery - 3.5* , battery life is nice can run whole day with normal and some gaming no problem but one issue they said it was 5000mah battery but if you check in any Phone information app on Google Play they show only 4100mah battery so you can check yourselfCons  to be considered:-Now there is no gyroscope or electronic compass in sensors , no or blaster ,no type c , no fingerprint sensor.In 7k i would not recommend this phone redmi 7a is much better deal or realme c3 , but since i got it in a exchange of only 2300 rupees i think it's bang for buck deal for me, but GST are increased to 18% so if you buy any 10000 phone you will pay 1800 or 2k to tex in government so smartphone prices are increased dramatically , that's why they are no longer value for money phone in smartphone market right now.Amazon service is really incredible for exchange, i try to exchange my phone through flipkart but they denied for no reason they have fraud exchange policy. But i have very nice experience with Amazon service , the delivery boy was good too ,Thanks for fantastic service Amazon.Thanks for your time and reading this long review.I will update later"
Super phone...,5,"  Phone looking is very niceBattery back up is very niceIn this price range ,this mobile is goodBut camara is not that much good but okNot coming any case along with mobile,they should have provided case.Over all mobile is very nice..."
Good,5,  Amazing product with this price
Go for it!,5,  The phone is good to give an elder person who does not need a very powerful phone. It's also gotta  large  screen that apt for reading. I say go for it as a budget phone. Gifted it to my mother... She is not the least bit tech savvy. I have not tried any heavy gaming on it so cannot say.The daylight photos are stunning and clear. Have not checked not time pictures.The charger get the phone charged pretty quick.Using it for fifteen days.Go for it!
A downgrade over Redmi 8A. Not worth it.,3,"  When you consider its predecessor the 8A/8A Dual, this one is a major downgrade. A sluggish Helio chipset, Type B charging port, an unnecessarily tall screen, bad camera all combine to deliver a not so VFM product. I am saying this coz I have the 8A Dual as well... Not impressed. With every series, there are too many compromises which is very much unlike Redmi"
Great value for money with low budget,4,  It doesn't comes with fingerprint sensor althought phone has massive battery with decent processors.charging around 2.5 hrs to complete from 0 to 95%. I didn't face any bugs right now. Made of this phone is excellent build quality and big screen added much advantage  it comes with 10w mi charger not supports fast charging.
Value for your money,3,  Value for money....Mediatec processor is bit slower.. dont expect a good cam..Frond cam was good  ...A good phone for older people who did not use much apps...6800 INR
Not so good,3,"  Camera quality is not as per the expectations, with 13 mp you get better camera quality but this phone has bad camera quality pics along with phone volume very less. Average phone i would say for regular use but doesn't justify it's specifications."
Radmi 9A,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
It sucks,1,"  Within 4 months of buying this phone, the storage was full. I didn't get even half of the 32 gb this phone bragged about. And that's all because of the useless pre-installed apps this phone comes with that no one, NO ONE, needs. I can't get rid of those stupid Xiaomi apps. This sucks. Never buying from Xiaomi again."
Good for below average users.,3,  The performance is not as good as specified in the discription. Camera parameters are good but the picture is not as good as it should be with these specifications. Overall it is good for below average users. But don't think of playing games on it as it hangs even on playing simple games like subway surfers. Battery is good and lasts about a day.
JUST A SIMPLE PRODUCT. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH,4,  To be frank it is a good product for the priceYou can't expect too much from it‚Ä¢The camera is ok type but not much features in editing the photos‚Ä¢There too many in built apps but they can be removed if not required‚Ä¢The screen is not bright at all its really dull to see‚Ä¢good delivery by amazon‚Ä¢Only good thing is that you get 3gb with 32 GB storage and a really big screen‚Ä¢It is good for people who don't expect much from their mobiles and use phones for a basic necessity‚Ä¢If you are looking for more features then I do not recommend this you have other options in this price‚Ä¢You also need to buy a cover and screen protector‚Ä¢The box only has the phone with charger and the manual with invoice of bill
Better to not to purchase MI products,1,  I am writing this review after 6 months....After 6 months phone was automatically restart & some time it will go to off mode it may takes 1 or 2 day's to  come back to on mode.... Service center guys saying bord issue but this boar was not available now....

It is even light weight....By the way I really like it..

Great Phone at this Budget and Ultra Fast Delivery.,5,"  I really Love Redmi Phones. My First Phone was Redmi 8A. I bought this phone as a Gift for my Dad.Great offers by Amazon for this Phone. You cant Buy a Super Smartphone Like this at a Price Range of 7500 Rs - 3GB  RAM Variant anywhere in the Online World or at Retail Stores. I love the Fact that Redmi 9A is Far Lighter than Redmi 8a. I ordered the Phone on 2nd November and i Got it on 3rd November. It was not even a Complete day, as there was 2 hrs left for a day to complete. Fastest Delivery by Amazon even for a Standard Delivery Order. I would love to continue my Shopping with Amazon.You can Go for this Phone Blindly.Such a Feasible phone. Love it."
Good deal for the price offered .,4,"  Overall the mobile phone is ok for the price , should have provided fingerprint scanner which is very common now , battery life is good , camera üì∏ is somewhat ok , look is good , very good for normal user , no hesitation in recommending this product ."
its good,4,"  Purchased for my dad, used past 10 days and seems good so far. Look and feel, build, battery life is good. Features are smooth. not played any games and also not done any multi processing so not sure about performance."
Good phone,2,"  good phone for money 7500, 32gb memory, 3gb ram enough is good for normal use, hd display awesome, Played game temple run, Visualation is outstanding, quick response in touch, sound quality average. Camera portrait mode is super. Selfie camera very average.Missing futures infrared remote control, finger print sensor, lighting sensor.overall okay for the budget"
Worth for money,4,"  Writing this review after using this phone for some weeksThis phone is absolute worth for moneyBut iam not a giving a five star rating because iam ana ios lover and generally iam using ios phonesI brought this for my grandfather and by his opinion it's perfectBt i feel a problem that 3gb ram feature is only in it's boxSo if you are a game lover iam not suggesting this for you , but it's perfect for middle agedThe fingerprint sensor is fastBattery life is also goodAmd the camera quality is averge"
"Waste of Money, Worst Processor (MediaTek)",1,"  Battery is good , but mediatek processor is worst , too much hanging and slow processFor Adapter Data Cable is very short arround 1.2 feet , You need Buy One apart from this, it's a extra expense to buy a data cable.Only good thing is no heat producing on charging as well as normal usage , Battery is Superb, arround 1 full day if you are using continuousBetter go Redmi 8A DualSingle star for Redmi 9A, I wasted my money, there is no exchange options for this phone"
Review after 2 day use.,5,"  Camera quality: good image attached from both facing rear and front.Battery life : after full charge work 2 day with all the activities you can doFinger print : doesn't have finger printGlass and display : very crystal clear display but glass is not Corning gorilla.AI Face Lock: working good, some time it's not recognize."

Recommended,5,"  A very good item at this price range, bought two pieces for my kids, they loved it, they used it for playing games( Pubg,) they say it run smooth. Big battery..last whole day. Camera, sound and all other features are up to the mark."
Charger kit missing,1,  Need charger kit missing . Complained already raised . Not am issue my mobile .Am already paid temper glass and back cover . This explanation alt submit to customer care . Also my son study online class . Some education app . Already downloaded . So not possible submit to u my mobile . Need only charger kit. By krishnamoorthy .Advice to delivery person .
Nice Buy for parents,5,  I bought 2 GB Ram mobile for my parents. Its working well and surprisingly it looks slim and weight also less compare to other 5000mps battery mobiles. Big display is the game changer here. User friendly OS.For elders they dont need finger scanner . Finally satisficed with the all round impression under the price of 6200/-Average camera can not expect more at this price range at this moment.
Overall a good product in budget.,4,  I liked its processing speed which is very good. The ram is genuinely faster. Camera quality is average. Battery backup in this range is also good. The only problem with this model is that it does lack a good internet speed. I mean whatever sim card you are using this device will not give that much internet speed than what you expect. Sometimes the experience is horrible. The internet speed is very slow in this device whether you use any 4g sim. But what do you expect in this budget. It is a budgeted phone with some limitations.
Budget Friendly,3,"  Purchased this for my Mom. I don't say that this is an awesome mobile but I can tell you that at this price range it's okay to gift this to people for normal usage. Although the camera quality wasn't good at all, I was happy with the ram and storage provided at this price range.Camera Quality: 1/5Processor: 3/5Battery Life: 5/5Worth the money: 4/5"
Not at all happy with the product üòï,1,  I have ordered this Redmi 9A mobile phone as it is reasonable and compatible with my daily use as per the reviews which i got but unfortunately after owning it i have had very bad experience with the battery as it always heats up to the extreme and seems like it can explode any moment..and that too it was for the first time i have connected the charger and was shocked when it got heated up.I request the product approval team to please take a look into this issue with the product.I hope won‚Äôt be disappointed next time.Thank you!
How phone working,4,  Nice phone
- Phone hangs very frequently - Battery life is not reliable if you travel a lot.,3,  Like:- Features which exist in this price range of 6.5K -7K. Makes the phone affordable to many looking out for budget phone with an aim to use for 3 yrs.Dislike: Honest feedback from an educated & wise user.- Phone hangs very frequently (Even when space is enough nd the phone is new like 1 month)- Battery life expires in 24hrs. if you internet is on & talk continuously (I do due to my work). in 12hrs. if you watch too many online videos or listens music.
Value for money,5,  The product is awesome. Looking drop dead eye‚ù§
Nice product within the given price range!,5,"  Redmi 9A (32 GB) is a good mobile phone for those with limited budget. It has got all the nice features and functions. The screen is big, good fingerprint reader, amazing battery life, and a nice camera quality.The phone functions smoothly overall."
Cheap and best,4,"  It is worthable for this price, we can't play pubg and equal to pubg games. For online class this one much enough for the school and college students, it doesn't come with headphone,Camera quality rear is good and the front is OK for online class not for over exposure,It doesn't have finger print, screen size is bigger.I can suggest the people who is trying to buy this product.Seller send me the courier with safe and goodWe can buy it.Enjoy all!"
Best budget phone.,5,  I bought it for 5199 Rs with exchange (samsung J7) . I'm not much into camera or gaming. I bought it for daily use. Best battery life and good camera. Big screen makes watching movie great. Totally good buy for 5199 Rs.
Go for it if you have a tight budget!,4,"  1) Battery life is great!!üëåNo heating problem is found...2) Back camera is good in this price...3) While video recording with front camera i have found little bit hazy, but while taking selfie it is clear, could not understand why this is happening...4) Time taken for full charging from 20% battery life :- 2 hrs with its 10w charger5) Voice recording is very good & clear! Perfect for singers...6) A fingerprint sensor should be provided!‚òπÔ∏è7) Display is also Nice...8) Otherwise satisfied in this price..."
Decent. But worse camera,3,  Overall mob is good. They say it has 32gb storage available but when u get the mobile due to all internal apps u get only 20gb left. Never felt lag Or hang due to multie use of apps. Os quite ok. But worst thing is camera. It's almost same quality as some keypad mobile. And they have done a frod saying it's 13 mp but only 10 mp!!!!!!!!!! with badquality. And photos do not have shot on redmi. Exept camera overall decent mobile
Nice Phone at this price.,5,"  Redmi 9A is a good phone for normal use. The battery life is really encouraging. Battery lasts for almost two days even if Social medias are used. Sound quality is good, Camera is good at its level.Overall a value for money phone."
"Don't Buy,, Useless Camera,, Awesome UI",2,"  Don't Buy,, below avg Camera, for 13 MP, Its not even 2MP camera, Camera has very Low (live FP), MI WAS GOOD BUT NOW MI IS MAKING MONEY, My old MI 6 prime is better than this it has which cost 6000INR,, GO for RealMe C2,  same 13 MP camera for 7000 INR only, is Awesome...

Good,3,  No finger print. Just below average phone. It's good for an average use. But its Worth of 7500. Good for online class. I think no other company gives 3gb ram and 32 gb memory with 5000 mah battery and fine camera quality. With 7500 rs
Wow redmi 3rd quality,1,"  This phone is looking good but working bad,very lowest quality phone.If I want search number with any alphabet in contact takes to much time ,all time slow working.So dont buy this phone .Other wise you will  realise after purchae me like because return window has close ,so I have no option.Waste my money."
Not good.,3,"  Direction sensor(magnetometer sensor)not in this phone.You can't get directionality when using maps(you will be always facing one direction.)Apart from this everything is fine for this budget.Not better than Redmi8A dual.I am satisfied with this phone because this is my secondary phone.But for thu guys who are having this as their first,you have better options if using a vouple of hundreds more."
4Star,4,  Redmi9A is really a best phone under this price but when we talk about its camera its third class and you can't buy this phone for photography purpose. Overall phone is good for normal working.
Excellent üëå,5,  My review after using it for 12 daysBest smartphone in this budgetSmartphone is very fast and smooth workingOnly defect is that the camera quality is average but at this price it's perfect
ordered on diwali sale,5,  when ordering your m-phone online you can't review cam. battery health etc.You might be wasting time.That's already available in bulk on YT.You can get detailed review of all there. Talking about order and exp. i've been ordering now since quite a while approx. mpre than 4-5years now.Delivery agent was quite polite this time.packing was excellent.product was up to the mark.every thing was good.Go for it![ amazon ]
Lovely,5,  Good product
Defective display panel,2,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†The dispaly went flickering from the moment I unpacked the phone and booted it. Disappointed and ordered a replacement. Issue didn't resolve even in multiple reeboots or taking MIUI update after first boot."
Not satisfied,2,  I ordered this phone 1 month ago in the flash sale ...that time I got that phone ..& it was written Made in India...But yesterday I received my 2nd phone.it is written Made in China...why is this? I am really confused...& My space button is not working at the time of contact saving.
Fabulous 1,5,"  Again 1 more redmi 9 series with our family. This time for our mother-in-law. We hope in first sights itself looks like made for her, simple and user friendly phone with all good feature's,,, great to go head,,,"

A great buy for Under 7k.,3,"  ""Battery life"" is great to be honest. i like the display tall, Bright. ""camera quality"" is not match any expectations. Expectations was quite average though for this price point. bloatware always been a hurdle for Mi phones.If You get it under 7K 3gigs ram go for kill.""Game performance"" was good as per the price G25 surprisingly Good processor. Overall a value for money. Ditching Fingerprint not a great option though."
Overall good performance,5,"  The one thing which every Xiaomi mobile is having is its abnormal weight compared to other mobile brand phones of similar features. The camera does not reach up to the expectation but the overall performance of the mobile phone is all ok. It has no fingerprint sensor, thus allows only face and other unlocking systems. An average person can definitely go for it if they dislike Vivo."
Even a one-star rating is more to it.,1,"  Just after 47 days of purchasing it, I got a problem with the phone. It started to reboot in a loop. Then I took it to the servicing center. The problem was resolved. I wish I could end this happily ever after. But, my happiness didn't last long. Hell! it didn't even last for 2 hours. The very next day I went to the servicing center again, the story repeats. SO I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE, as it's a waste of your time, energy, and money."
Phone,5,  The best phone üìûThis phone was good quality and camera and strogeBest priseNice phone üìû
Overpriced. Go for redmi 9i on Flipkart.,2,  Good battery life but expensive for this price tag as you can get redmi 9i at same price on Flipkart. Both mobiles are same but 9i has 4gb ram & 64gb memory.Go for Redmi 9i on flipkart.3gb ram lags a bit.
Exceptionally cool,5,"  Splendid trendy smart phone, great finish, touch sensors, display in par with more upmarket products.In a budget friendly way, suits basic function, üì∑ is good.Worth the price quoted.Thank you."
Great Mobile with all basic features perfectly matched,5,"  Excellent mobile, bought it for my mother great battery life and nice Camera for the price, My Mother makes phone calls watches YouTube and WhatsApp and she gets nearly 3 days of battery life, she is very happy, small problem is the earpiece sound is a bit low."
Nice phone,5,  Best mobile phone
Device is a pathetic,1,"  The phone quality is best but the performance isn't.The phone gets usually hang within 2 appa running in the background. You can't expect more From this device. I'm using this phone for only Calling purpose for my company sim. I have OP 7 pro for my uses, but this phone is really needs a strong software database, good camera quality, ram performance for smooth use."
Sought of Good Mobile at this price,4,"  The display of the mobile is good enough and battery life is awesome. Camera is you can say OK sought but what to expect in such a low price. A little bit hanging issue due to 2GB RAM , else otherwise everything is good. I got it for Rs.6120 (10% SBI credit Card discount) . You can go for it."

Service center found mother board fault & change it, after that in play store log in itself it turned off again permanently. 2nd service center visit updated the software & it started working. Now if I use it for 2-3 minutes continuously it restarts. Forget about gaming or any smartphone activity."
Not taking update,1,"  Not taking update for Google Chrome and webview system. I called up Amazon customer care, but they did not respond and behavior of customer executive was very wrost"
Average phone- serves its cost,3,"  Average phone, do not expect too much in case of performance. For first time touch pad buyers, if u have already used better configuration u won‚Äôt like it at all. This phone is to give a budgeted gift. Teenagers better put some more money and buy better one.."
Good product,4,  Quality is good in the price range below Rs 7000  battery does not last long and camera captured quality will be ok if you are looking for high quality camera or high battery back up you need to buy higher version model in higher price segment
A unbeatable budget kingü•∞,5,  Got the product today. I am so much happy with the build quality and look of the phone .No other phone have this asthetic look in this price segment.Camera quality also so good. Main attraction about this phone is its display. It's a big gorgeous HD panel in its segment.Considering all things redmi did a great jobWith 9AGO blindly with this product of your budget is 6999
Hangs a lot with a black screen and stops working,1,  Bought two phines and It's been 7 days only and both the phone starts hanging along with a black screen and then needs a restart.‡•§‡•§Worst part is I am not able to avail servicing facility by amazonAlso brand service is ignoring my complaints

You can watch 720p videoPerformance : No lag in day to day useage .Run smoothly every app.***No heating problemOverall product is good and value for money"
Average android phone,2,"  Heat problem and less battery backup, hope this will be fixed in android update."
good as a gift,4,  this product is for the people who are in search of average smartphone in an average price range. camera is a little average and it feels a little heavy probably due to its 5000Mah battery and large body but performance is good and there is no heat problem over heavy uses even. This is not for gaming purpose but i played lite games and performance was good. Overall good for general purpose.
Just Average product,3,  Its not an i was expecting. The disappointed me this time. As i come camera of redmi and other with same megepixel i found other much better than it. Battery is good you can use it full day and charger is also fast . But for very normal usage you can bought this product but if you are heavy user dont think about it. It lags sometime.
Excellent Phone at affordable price.,5,  The phone is excellent. Super fast charging. Camera is very decent. Screen is bigger than earlier versions of Redmi phone. Highly recommended.Go for it.üëçüëç
nice,5,  This product from redmi is fine under this price but the display is really bad i think so if you are willing to add some more money üí≤ then go for other product
"Terrible Face Unlock, No Fingerprint sensor",1,  1- Display quality sucks. 720p video seems like 480p.2- Cameras are terrific.3- Too much lags.4- Unstoppable Miui ads.5- Face Unlock usually takes 5-10 seconds and most of the time it doesn't work.6- No Fingerprint sensor.7- Battery is draining more quickly and fast charging is also gone after 5 months.Bottom line- Don't buy this Covid phone.
"Wrong Product, fake promises",1,"  Brought a phone only when it was written  it would be manufactured in India, but when it was delivered we got a made in China product ...... Absolutely fake promise by Amazon ...... When I initiated a replacement request there's no one to acknowledge..... Pathetic service.........!!!!!!!"
Network catching problem,4,  Phone is good. But mobile network catching problem very slowly.you tube not open in my mobile.sir I am very sad.please write down my information
Best phone of rs 6500,5,  I think it is the best phone of rs 6500 no othe company can give us so better product as redmi 9a it is very good phone for lite use but if u are a heavy user then u have to excess your range at 10000Sorry not for pubg or freefire users  but helio p25 is a good prossessor........... It also may not for a camera loveThanks for reading .............................. üôè

Made in china,1,"  Made in china, build quality bad, speaker also not good...pls go with redmi 9 or redmi 9 prime made in india version"
Good product for the price but could be better if included a back cover & screen guard,4,  Overall good product nominal peformance for daily tasks but not at all suggested for multitasking or gaming or photography coz AF its a budget phone so just fits right with the regular flow. No back cover & screen guard & takes lot of time to charge

Worst ever I seen.,1,"  Camera quality is not good,touch screen behaves unintended input when you make call by close by ear.Flash Light seems low power.Face locking system is not much better as expectation.No Magnetic Sensor, so you can't use compass feature or app.Some of bluetooth headset v5 doesn't works.*** I will suggest better to go for another ****"
Ok phone but as per price & performance its a little high priced,3,  Frequent call drops happen. Good screen etc & camera quality but battery is not that good especially if you have you are connected to data or wifi most times. Most annoying is the call drops & you have to redial & connect.Overall an OK phone which could have been priced lower with the quality it possesses
Don't purchase this.Go for any other phone .,1,"  The processor is extremely slow , even can't process Chrome browser efficiently .Absolute waste of money ,choppy apps.Camera is a disaster with lot of noise and poor light sensing technologyHigh contrast is visible in photos.Poor quality at low light .Don't purchase thisIf you r still here ,that proves u r dumb to think about purchasing this."
Worth buyable under this price.,4,"  Ordered nature green coloured mobile, Amazon delivered in 2 days. Colour is slightly different (dark) than what is visible on site. Battery performance is superb and processor performance is upto the mark. Indoor pics are not good with its camera."

Crashed and useless after 2 months,1,"  Worst mobile ever, within 2 months it got cashed. Everyone time i open the mobile it displays MiUi and got shut down. There is no option over Amazon to return/replace after 10 days now, where to complain to who should we reach out there is no clue at all."
"Third Class, too slow, waste of money phone",1,"  I specially recommended you to don't buy this phone. If you're planning to buy for your old parents or uneducated people meaning they will use only RED & GREEN buttons than you can buy otherwise please avoid buying.Too slow and hanging phone, talking about other features meaning insulted them.PURCHASING A FEATURE PHONE WILL BE GOOD INSTEAD OF IT."

Made in China,2,  The product is made in China and how mi is selling in India after the ban of Chinese phones in India.
worst mobile,1,"  Worst mobile ever, primary function of mobile is calling yet this mobile showing unique problem that on calling fellow person doesnt hear voice at all. as well service centre not able to solve problem. worst camera quality ever."
Good entry level device,4,"  I was looking for an entry level budget phone with latest features, this device serves the purpose, natural green color is awesome.  Beware, the device comes with 'Made in China' label."
Not buy 2gb ram,3,  The built quality is good not great if you are buying this please by the 3gb variant which gives more value of you by GB variant it will lag under 2 months
"Entry level, Value for money,",4,"  Battery life is good after use of intense calls, internet and video lasting for 3 days. Camera quality is good for entry level user. Value for money. So far not use for gaming."
Value for old exchange mobile,5,  Good! as purchased this mobile in exchange offer which is the best in deal. Good battery life. Good picture quality. Overall my experience is 10 out of 10. Thanks amazon for this wonderful exchange offer.
After using one month 9A,4,"  It is fully budget phone for mostly aged people to user smart phone, with low cost and high performance.If you want to use for long term and less use of apps and gaming then go for this 9A which is having good battery backup big screen with 3 GB ram etc."
Below average phone,2,"  It is very slow, lags a lot and hangs occasionally. It gets heated up if you use internet for long. No Gorilla glass, no fingerprint sensor, battery backup is good and camera is ok. Big screen with average display and Sound is a bit low. Dual apps and split screen function is missing. Its a low budget phone from Redmi. Go for better options"
Phone is slow,1,"  I found the phone a bit slow and lags in certain areas. Previously, I was using redmi 7a, 2Gb so I thought this phone might a good upgrade. But disappointed."
"Phone for people who uses Youtube, Whatsapp and for calls.",4,"  The product is decent in the price range. If you use the phone moderately only for calls, youtube or WhatsApp, then this is the best phone. I bought it for my mother and she felt happy, The screen is big and the battery is also good only if you use it moderately. Bought it for 6200 rupees."
Mobail so good and camera quality,5,"  Mobail so good and camera quality osm and battrary is so good, fingerprint one touch finger"
Not a good option,1,  1- Mobile is very slow. Skype app buttons response in 15 seconds.2- Touch of mobile is really bad.3- camera is also very poor.4- this mobiles comes with customised os. Which includes lot of third party apps which makes this mobile slow.5- finger or biomateic is not available.
Nice screen,5,  Battery life is good. I've been using it for 2 months now and it's great. It handles all social media apps very well and the calling audio quality is very good.
Terrible phone. Not even value for money.,1,  There is no magnetometer or gyroscope. Compasses wont work and even google map wont show which direction i am facing accurately. I bought it and regretted my purchase within the hour. No value at all for me. There is a lot of false advertising in other review websites which prompted me to get this.
Worth buy,5,  If you want to purchase a mobile under 6.8k it will be a better one. Giant display at 6.8k. Massive battery backup. Bought the mobile for Rs.6120 in great indian festival.
Slow as snail,2,  The phone is super slow. If one is navigating from one app to another it takes 5-6 second to open.If you open chrome it takes 10 second to open.Camera quality is not good (though the expectations from camera was not much).
9a mobile is good another,5,  Premium look..
Think twice.,3,"  Display and camera quality are too poor, else phone is ok, so it's better to spend few more buck for a better experience. However phone is good for new users."
Good From Xiaomi!,5,  Got this for 6400‚Çπ during the sale and feels like it satisfies the price paid for the device! Good product from Xiaomi! Go for it
POOR QUALITY MOBILE,3,"  I have been using the redmi 9A mobile for 7 months. Atfirst I think it will be good mobile, but now it seemed not good. Its scrolling is not smooth, sometimes it hangs, it shows full network signal but doesn't give net speed and even youtube doesn't continue smoothly. I don't play any online games like freefire or others. Camera isn't good. Only one thing is its battery is good."
WiFi hotspot doesn't connect to Laptop,3,"  Handset is fine for daily usage, video calling, zoom meeting etc. But the biggest drawback is its WiFi hotspot doesn't get connected to Laptop. I had tried several troubleshooting but nothing has worked. Really disappointed with this as I need to work on my laptop with internet on."
Not a Good Handset in,2,"  Not a good handset, its very slow and camera quality is not good. It had purchased it for my dad. Sold it back on olx after 1 month. The only best thing is battery. Charges quickly and runs long"
Super,5,  Excellent battery back upFingerprint reader goodCamera quality also good in this range especially capturing in low light.Overall good deal.
I claim replacement of device / smart phone as  this product is under warranty period .,1,"  Our product purchased from Amazon is under warranty , manufacturing defect as wel as battery performance.But sorry to report that while charging the battery of this smart phone ,this device has been fully destroyed due to blast of the battery of smart phone .So plz replace this product with a new one as per the warranty."
Not worth for money,1,"  Camera quality is poor, battery life is better. Don't get fooled by the average ratings. Never go for this. Go for some other phones at this rate please read reviews in another site before buying this phone.  Posting the review for third time. Hope this will get posted this time."
Too slow....not worth it...,1,"  Camera quality is not so good, initially I thought phone is nice. However, after using this, m so frustrated and it's too slow. It's a waste of money. Don't buy this. Once again telling, it's very very slow..... please don't refer my previous comment"
Good for Average user's,4,  In the budget it's worth to buy.Worth to spent every penny.Good design and built.üîã Battery backup is fine
Everything is good except camera quality,4,"  I bought this mobile for my mom, she likes it. Everything is good in this mobile like display, sound, battery life, etc except the camera quality.

Awesome budget phone,5,"  Very good , I particularly like the large display and the immense battery ."
Super smartphone for older people (brilliant beginners phone)......,4,"  Decent phone for this price range. But I am not recommend this phone to any youngster who is approaching this phone with an intention to play games. If battery, decent camera (with gcam) are your  main concern then go for it. You can also enjoy other features which normal smartphone offers nowadays."
Worth the price,4,  The handset is good1. Great battery life.2. Display has good pixels.3. Screen is big.4. Ram speed is very fast.5. Camera quality is so so.6. Network hold a lot
Not upto the mark,2,"  It takes nearly 3 hrs to charge fully. And battery draining quickly, though they mention duration hrs as 2 days. Camera quality is ok not that much. And while charging mobile is heat up as I kept in fire.specifications seems to be awesome but disappointed with its working condition. We cannot spend 7k often with these issues."
Best Budget Smartphone at 7499üòç,4,"  If You Want to Buy a budget smart phone then really blindly go for this...With A Good Potrait Camera quality, good processor,3gb ram n of course a large battery backup almost 2 days battery life if you are a normal user. It doesn't have fm radio n gorilla glass protection overall it is a budget smart phone at 7500.Go for this"
Good phone,5,  I tried for 3 GB RAM phone but unfortunately got only the 2 GB one. Memory is the only one constrain noticed.
Long term review,3,  Happy with EMI option as it made the purchase affordable.Thanks Amazon.Product is good value.Would have liked a hard case to be bundled.The Micro USB charging port is cumbersome(User is a Senior Citizen)Would have preferred a non Chinese brand.
Plz ignore RKLLP seller - Box was not sealed when I received the product. Packing isn‚Äôt also proper.,4,"  Please choose another seller to buy this phone, RKLLP seller first experience too bad.Phone is okay with this price, looks great..."
Best mobile phone in that price range,4,  Great phone at that price point. Other leading brands do not offer these specs in that price range. Well built and really lightweight phone. Love the color though. Long battery life. Great for kids to attend online classes.
"Value for money,",5,"  Overall good product at this price point, Xiomi claiming made in India product, but we received made in China, I had never thought that I will get made in China product. It's very disappointing for me, Amazon delivering most of product  made in China."

Battery problem.Not  switch on the mobile,1,  After 18 days my redmi9A is not working .I am totally disappointed totally waste of money right now what to do I dnt know
Five star,5,  I have been using Redmi smartphone for the last 3 years. This one I bought for my mother. She likes it very much. Redmi never disappoints me.
Good,4,"  The ph is good latest os but no light for notification I had old Redmi model which had it,They have written 10w fast charger in box but I got 5w only."
Don‚Äôt buy please - waste mobile version,1,  Don‚Äôt buy - defective mobile version . After 10 th day mobile is not charging and it‚Äôs off . As per new policy can‚Äôt even refund . Worst experience. Amazon please take off this mobile version and don‚Äôt sell this kind of faulty mobile versions . Be aware guys Don‚Äôt buy this and save ur money .
Very bad product,1,  Product is very bad. Mobile is heating up very much and screen colour changes after using it for ten days. Some heat waves comes out from the mobile. First time I received such a bad product from Amazon.
Nice phone.,5,"  The phone has a good battery backup (normal use) and nice design.The camera is okay. One problem that I noticed is that: the system apps use internet even the data is disabled. So, I have disabled the mobile data for all apps to avoid losing balance(since no data pack is active in that SIM)."
Decent Phone for a Decent Price,4,  There will always be Pros and Cons even if you buy a lac phone but for this price it justifies the quality and features fairly
"Long battery life, great functionality and fast",4,"  Good, easy to use, functional phone with good speed and apps. I need to charge only twice a week which is awesome. The camera quality is just average or a bit under but that is not why I bought this phone. Other than the picture/video qlty, everything else is awesome. Great value for money."
Good colour and designed,5,  It's battery life and memory are remarkable. It's a great experience to use a redmi phone in this price. It's really a great product
Worth the price!,4,"  Thank you Amazon for delivering the product superfast. The Redmi 9A mobile is worth the price. Not much expectations from the range yet it functions optimum. Good battery, smooth operation, easy AI response for camera and good processing speed."
Nice,3,"  This phone only for simple usage persons or children, don't expect high performance but best in this price segment"
I lost my trust in MI.,1,  I lost my trust in MI.I really dilike its quality. Means this phone is hanging since the day i start using it.Toally dissastisfied with it .Waste of money!Waste of efforts!I will never every buy any phone of MI. As it hangs.
Best Phone in 7K price range!,5,"  If you ask for one word to describe Redmi 9A it is 'smooth'. It functions effortlessly with 3GB RAM, and every feature sails without nay trouble. Camera is the only con, but how much can one expect in this price range. Well done, Redmi."
Nice phone in this budget,4,  Battery is very very good and other features is also very good in this price. Only negative thing in this phone is weight
Value for money,2,  Value for money but it goes to hanging mode many times.  Had to update the Android.  After that it started working well but it keeps happening. That is irritating.
Camera is cheap n worst but average  phone is good,3,"  With camera not happy, another brand in this range gives good AVG camera ,but all avg it is working well ,writing this after using this phone for 3 months"
Value for money,4,  Due to 2GB ram and pre installed redmi apps the phone is bit laggy but as per price and brand its good. Go for nature green colour its awesome!
Probably the best we can get in this price range,5,"  Got it for my mom, she uses it for over 8h at a stretch, and still has quite a battery life. Redmi has been improving monstrously. The camera quality is so so, but we don't aim for professional photography with it so doesn't bother, performance wise it's the best in this price range"
overall good experience,3,  what do you expect in this price range?. mi has bundled pretty much everything in it. plus blue is also my favourite color so if you are planning to buy it just go for it. good phone at this price range.

"Not fit for students, this product deserves for parents and grandparents",3,"  This phone is useful for the one who doesn't uses phone much like parents , grandparents, etc.... (only if your parents or grandparents are not highly educated) as camera quality is very poor , processor is low end , doesn't fit for large graphic games ."
Pls hit helpful button if you like the review.,3,  Hello. The Redmi 9A phone I bought is fine. I bought these phones for my parents they loved it. Proformence of the phone is good but camera is not as I expected. It comes with preinstalled apps which you can uninstall if you want. Value for money product.

Problem not happy,1,  Problem im not happy
Don't buy this phone,1,  Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.
One of the good choice for low budget phone,4,  If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look
Bad camera and made in China,1,  Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.
Simply excellent. Read complete review written after my 30 days of experience,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."

Value-For-Money & Recommended for a normal user,4,"  I purchased it for my Mother, Decent product in this price range.* Looks beautiful and elegant.*Initial Performance is good for a normal user and clipped to be alright for everday use. not recommended for gamers.*  Front and back cameras are avarage and good in this price range. AI based potrate mode works fine. In this price range this is fine so far.* Bigger display and fairly decent and good enough for videos.*Most of the preloaded apps are uninstallabe and storage management is also decent.*Battery is main pro to be highlighted, in this price range 5000mah battery is superb and does it job.*Sound is crisp and clear and call quality is also decent**Main Con : Charger included in the box is not 10W as xiaomi advertised and it is a normal 5W. It make a littlr bit time to juice up 5000 mah battery."
Poor,1,  Battery is getting drained out quite fast. 7% in an hr. with half an hr of usage. Camera is also poor. Charging is very slow that was known though. First point is troubling!
Dont buy it as lower model is good then this,3,"  Not as good as redmi 8a, no type C , no fast charge, sound is low compared to remi 8a, display is also poor compared to redmi 8a , camera is nonsense. you should by redmi 8a or 8a dual.You can buy this if above are not problematic to you....... As this phone cost 1k lesss then other"
BUDGET WORTHY PHONE,5,  Nice phone.. overall performance is just amazing
Poor processor basic UI also lagging,3,"  COVID 19 drastically changed everything. Looks display value for the money but performance is very low I haven't installed any single app but phone lags a lot. But in this present situation it is the best phone for online classes. Camera is good, battery is awesome. So decide your choice"

Please..... üôè don't Buy. Cheapest product from MiüëéDon't Believe in Paid Adverstiment,1,"  Review after one-day full usage and 28 days of usage. overall I am very disappointed with this phone. üòû. I never expected such a phone from MI.  Mi is cheating people by providing a low-quality display. If I have an option to return this Phone üì±, definitely I will return.Pros: Battery - Battery backup is a fantastic feature of this phone. One day full use drained only 29% üòÄ. The phone is too lightweight ‚ò∫Ô∏è and very handyüòÑ Not felt any heating issue while charging and after long hours of usage. üòÉ.Cons :All apps are lagging.Camera - The camera quality is poor, both front and back camera. üò≠GPU - Graphics processor PowerVR GE820 can't draw even a single circle properly. üò†üò†.High-quality video & image rendering are also unsatisfactory.Processor - Mediatek Helio G25 is processor is not sufficient for this phone. üò•. Not feeling the benefits of 2GHz clock speed.Display - Size of the display is quite good üëçBut it has only 267 PPI. Even Redmi 4A (released in Nov 2016) has 296 PPI. üò†Display quality is too poor. üò´ Very cheap quality display.Ignorable Missing features -  No fingerprint sensor. ü•∫  No led in front of the display.üò∞Major Missing features -  No gorilla glass protection üò•If you planning to buy a phone within a low budget you can choose the next segment of phones with HelioG35 or aboveü§ó with at least above 290 PPI.Considering all factors, this is not a budget phone and Don't Buy."

Useless phone,1,  Redmi 9A launched useless phone everTotally waste moneySo please not buying this phone
Winner of the caparison by price is the realme.,3,  REALME batter than redmi now
Value for Money. Well done Redmi.,5,"  1. Display is excellent. Colors and sharpness is good.2. Descent cameras according to price.3. In hand feel of phone is good. It's slim and despite 5000 Mah battery, it feels light.4. Battery backup is good. Easily last one day.5. Performance is good according to price. Mediatek G25 does it job well. You can play COD and FREE FIRE easily at low settings.6. Speaker loudness is average but quality is good.7. MIUI 12 experience is amazing. No ads and reduced bloatware."

nice product,4,  Quite goodBattery and build quality is betterBut camera and speakers are okok.
Over all Ok,4,"  Advantage :3GB+32 For Rs. 7498/-With 6.5 Inch & 5000 mah Battery Acceptable.Disadvantage :*No Finger Print Sensor*Front Camera is 5 MP Only, if it's 8 MP & Rear Side 13+5 MP means little acceptable.Over all Ok."
Redme 9A,3,  No finger print....there is vast color difference in picture & actual . there is no matching in SEA BLUE color. piece received with DARK Blue colorotherwise good gadget at this price.
Best under budget phone,5,  Screen is big and crisp battery backup is great. You can find lag here and there but manageable don't expect gaming in this phone. Camera is below average. All together phone feels premium in look with below average performance. If tou are planning to buy in this budget no phone will beat this phone.
Smooth and satisfying,5,"  Bought 3gb 32gb sea blue variant.Very nice and smooth looking phone.Runs smoothly without any hiccups.The blue color is so amazing.Doesn't heat with prolonged use.Amazing battery, drains slowly and charges quickly.Display is very good.Quick delivery.Overall a must buy."
Good but not up to the mark,3,  Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times
Awesome loved it,5,  It's a beast in its segment. I was little worried about G25 but it handles daily tasks well. Take the 3GB variant as 2gb may feel sluggish. It's not built for gaming. Si gamers stay away. Peace!
Excellent phone,5,"  Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon"
Stopüî¥üî¥üî¥,2,  Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....
Cons and Pros,3,"  This is not value for money product because this product have 1k gst which is make hiked priceMi Apps which is un-necessary apps which is take space in storage and you can also deleted system apps and mi app through adb fastboot tools.Back design is very good n beautiful and also have texture liked finish since they r polycarbonate body which is doesn't upset me.Aspect Ratio Of Display is bad in redmi A's Series.Need Improvement.Processor is best for browsering , social networkingThis processor (G25) can be Pubg lite But after 15 mins played they started heating.Battery capacity is awesome ‚ô•Ô∏è no need to say. brightness level is good and it also handle with sun. Recommendation for online studying or nornal uses"
Goooooooood,3,  Weary good product  very fast delivery
Points to be noted,3,"  Points to be noted:üëâ The sound output of this phone is quite low as compared to other Redmi phones.üëâ This phone is much longer than other Redmi phones which can make it difficult to carry.üëâ Xiaomi previously provided IR blaster on its budget phones. It is now extinct in their budget phones.üëâ Xiaomi started giving ""Type-C"" port by upgrading its budget phones from Micro USB port, but after buying this phone I feel that now they have shifted to ""Micro USB"" port again.üëâ After purchasing this phone, I have understood very well that Xiaomi has cut prices in this phone."
Made in china,2,  Phone is good. But it is made in China
Best phone for PARENTS. 5/5 for Rs.6800,5,"  Best phone @6800 Rs.Suitable for Parents and kids for online study.Has no standard features like fingerprint scanner, dual camera, IR blaster, type C charging port, no back cover.But at this price in COVID situation, it's the best. Display is huge(20:9).Camera is above par.Performance is good.Overall best package.5/5 for Rs.6800."
Best in this price range,5,  Loved it but it is a bit heavy because of the battery and the run time is absolutely the best suits for my work camera is okay but hey I didn't expect the camera to be a dslr so no complaints there anybody who really want a budget phone just go for it
Wow,5,  Wow
Very worst,1,"  I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon."
Good,4,"  Good mobile,in this corona times if we want quality product for basic regular usage,this Redmi 9a 3 gb /32 bestCamera is average like all entry-level mobiles,Redmi might send an update for small big fixes like every new mobile launch,gcam till now not available,with that quality of camera increasesDesign display very good,slim tall mobileBattery very good,takes 2.5 hours for full charge,so better charge when 40 % battery left.People who are planning to buy 4 gb /64 gb Redmi 9a,don't take it ,best to go for Redmi 9 as we get finger print scanner, slightly better speed,camera and build quality for just 700rs moreSpeed of Redmi 9a is good for 3- 4 appsCons:No gorilla glass protectionNo Secondary noise cancelling mic,this is big mistake by redmi as they give in every mobileNo Finger print scannerFinally under 10,000 rs all Redmi 9 series mobiles are very best as they provide 4 gb ram variant in very price segment,only option we have"
Screen resolution is not good & worst camera ever.. rest so so..,2,  Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.
Value for money or not?,4,"  So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5‚≠ê for thatPros-‚Ä¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this range‚Ä¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.‚Ä¢Good for basic usage.‚Ä¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:‚Ä¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)‚Ä¢Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use‚≠ê"
Average,3,  A little bit slow..I think it will more lagged afterwards..Big screen.Camera is not good.. As well as selfie..Ph is For normal users..
Not up to the mark,1,  Not satisfied. No camera perfection. No finger sensor. Perfect China piece. Cheap and worst. Started hanging.
Nice deal in this price,3,  Pros-A big batteryBig screenGood lookNice processorValue for moneyCons-Poor camera quality both front and backDoesnt charge fastNo finger print sensor
Good entry level phone.however check what ur getting into,4,"  Good entry level phonePros: Big screen, MIUI12, Good batterly last for more than a day with average use,good cameraCons: single rear camera, no Corning glass screen,No radio, plastic back, 10w charger in box- takes long time to charge"

"Waste of money, Worst customer service.",1,"  I am never going to buy any electronic product from amazon anymore. Experienced worst customer service. Product is not upto the mark. Over heating, network connectivity issue was there. They were using their aaps to dignose in which everything will be showing normal. The same aap can not be used in any other phones for checking. That means this aap is specifically designed by amazone for amazon bought mobiles. You will never know if this is correct or not. Based upon that refund/ replancement will not be done. Amozon update your customer service otherwise if customers make you customers can also break you. After 2 days of continuos chasing no result. Wasted Rs 7498/-."

Not recommended and a cheating,1,"  Amazon is now becomes a cheater, there is no way to return the item..it has below shortcomings..Poor Camera quality, though it has feature for Portrait and Landscape but in landscape mode the clicked pictures are blurred...Poor battery performance, the 5000mAh battery is so poor that it significantly heats up entire phone within  2-5 minutes and drains the battery. Weight is also quite more.I tried to return the item, it says have a test with some software or talk to technical team (after uploading no. of things, very tedious), there are many sites in which you can have hassle free return...You will get frustrated and defiantly could not be able to return the item..there is no way to interact on email and call..so select the items very very carefully..otherwise they are sitting there to cheat your hard earned money...be careful.."

But the same issue happened with it also. So again I complained and I am so thankful to Amazon that they took my phone back and told me that they will refund my money. Phone was taken back, just waiting for my refund now.If you have a Jio sim, just go for it. It is an awesome phone but If you are Airtel or Vi customer then there will be some issue with VoLte and VoWifi."
Sea Blue ?? DARK BLUE IT IS....,3,"  The listing states SEA BLUE color.... Well its DARK DARK BLUE (Indigo/Purple type); so very disappointed there..otherwise Phone is overall good...4 Stars for Phone specs,2 Stars for wrong Color mention,So Overall 3 Starts Avreage!!"
We buyers must also do our homework before buying a high-tech product.,1,"  I want to share a live (semi-positive) experience with Amazon a week back. I purchased a Redmi 9A phone for my grandson on 21 Dec. The phone came on 24th, but wouldn't boot. I spoke to Cust Service, and they quickly arranged a replacement, but the delivery boy wouldn't give the new one because he couldn't get the IEMI# from inside the phone (which couldn't be booted in the first place). Another call to service, and somehow it got resolved and we got the replacement. And lo! - that too wouldn't bootü•µAnother round with service asking them for refund, but the delivery boy refused to pickup the replacement because #IEMI didn't match (AGAIN üò¢üò¢).Finally - probably after divine intervention-I was connected to a sympathetic service person who realised what was all this hullabaloo with IEMI#. Then the (second) bad phone was picked up on 1st Jan, and the money was refunded almost instantly. My daughter went to a real shop and purchased a Samsung M01 for her son the same day‚ùóMoral of the story: When you are buying things you don't know anything about, buy from a KNOWN, LOCAL supplier üôè"
China DESH KA PHONE......,3,"  Why do you advertise this phone as DESH KA SMARTPHONE. Did you know, What is the meaning of DESH?. I thought of buying a phone by made in India. But Amazon delivered to me a phone by made in China. Not just the phone, the charger and charging cable are made in China!. If we buy a smartphone at a discount, will you behave substandard manner?"

Video Audio quality.,4,"  Phone is good and battery backup is very nice,working long time. But one thing i faced that i bought on first sale i found one problem that video recording audio not good very low hearing then i returned that one and get change  with new. After getting new one i found that problem is same and that not problem its phone problem. Phone video recording audio is very low compare to others phone. I can't hear clear voice in even low distance recording."
Best for Average usage.,5,"  Overall mobile is good for an average usage. Its camera, audio quality is average to good. Its performance is very good because of good internal storage.Handy as well as the screen is quite wide and provides good viewing angle.Plus point is its battery which is quite huge. Has microusb slot and charger is of 10W thats why charging might be somewhat slow (not that fast)If you want the mobile for an average usage then this can be a best deal for you.I got this 2gb Ram 32gb Rom varient in 6800 Rs.Or if your usage is high i would recommend to go for some other Redmi products for price beyond 8000 to 9000.Below 7000 this product gives satisfactory performance."
Leaves a sour taste,1,"  Pros:1. Performance is Ok, for the price.2. 2 SIM + 1 Micro SD Card Slot, i.e. no hybrid slotsCons:1. Too many advertisements and installs 3rd party apps forcefully. This is not mentioned in the listing. This should be made mandatory. But thankfully practically almost everything can be uninstalled.2. Micro USB port for charging is unacceptable in 20213. Used a MIUI based phone long time ago, somehow I feel it has become much worse and confusing. Even changing your notification sound or ringtone takes some effort and a little bit of scratching your head. They should include a manual LOL."
Very Nice budget phone.,5,"  Ordered Redmi 9A 3GB 32GB version, sky blue for my mother 2 days ago. Delivery was quick. The delivery guy also opened the package on request for assurance. Got the product as ordered.Initial impressions:Pros:Large screen, Nice color, good processor, ample RAM for daily normal user, good battery backup, drains very gradually even if you are on calls whole day. Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions. (Very good in daylight or external use.)One of the best phones available in the market at this price. I have given it 5 star for specifications in this price range. I ordered it with an offer.. More than what you can get from any other Indian brand in 7000 rs."
"Very Fast, Superb Video Calling Clarity",5,"  I was using iPhone 6s Plus and when I got this phone for Rs. 7,500, I was surprised ! It have more display clarity and camera clarity than my iPhone. Also it is as fast as my iPhone. Mi have combined All features of ios and Android in this Phone, that make this phone special compared to other Android Phones. Its OS is Mi modified version of Android. The modified version is very intelligent and smart. It have removed all the disadvantages of Android Phones. It have iPhone features like Face unlock, time lapse video, burst mode and exposure increase and decrese in camera etc.Sound clarity also superb.My Brother in the US have amazed to see the better clarity of video calling than my previos iPhone."

Basic android smartphone,5,"  A basic android smartphone for basic android experience. If you're looking for an entry level smartphone with android os then this is a phone for you. This model packs a 3gb ram and 32gb internal storage which is more than sufficient for your daily needs from Facebook to YouTube and anything in between. If you want a basic android experience or just want a phone for your daily driver this one is for you. Do note this ain't optimal for heavy duty gaming. Casual gaming yes, but not heavy duty gaming."

"Most pathetic product - BE warned - DO NOT BUY !!! Battery, Memory and Bandwidth hogging phone.",1,"  This is the most pathetic product that I have ever had the misfortune to buy on Amazon - and you cannot return the product and hope to exchange it for something else because they do not permit ""RETURNS"" only ""REPLACEMENT""  - WITH THE SAME GODFORESAKEN PHONE!!!!!""It comes preloaded with MIUI and other inefficient memory, bandwidth  and battery draining bloatware and constant advertisements all over the place  - and there is no way you can disable them - by buying this phone you are compromising your data and security and paying for an advertiser to constantly bombard you with adverts for thoroughly useless products -  and you have to pay for the bandwidth he uses up.In an attempt to get rid of MIUI you cannot even flash a custom ROM like LineageOS or some of the other AltROMs cause the manufacturers of the device will not share the code. SO IF YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS DEVICE YOU ARE STUCK.Do not buy - if you happen to have paid for it then your fate is sealed - you cannot hope for a refund ---- better to spend that money on buying some cow dung - might help make a cow happy!"
Nice Phone for doing normal works,3,"  This phone is helpful in basic things, camera quality is not good at all, specially rear camera is not good it is really a 8mp camera but Redmi is saying it 12 or 13 MP...making fool to customers. Overall it is good for taking online classes, making calls, using whatsapp but not for gaming, you can play normal games but if you play games like free fire, it starts heating and lagging. Battery is actually 4800 mAh.."
"Durable phone, worth every single rupee!",5,"  I ordered the phone during amazon 1-month deepawali sale, when it was selling for Rs 6,800. I exchanged my old Redmi phone and got further Rs 3,600 off. Plus I made the purchase using HDFC Bank credit card and got 10% cashback. Net net, i got the phone for Rs 3,150.But buying the phone at a cheap price wasn't the highlight. Its performance has not disappointed me.The features have upgraded and the Redmi-9A offers more bang for the buck. Features are intuitive and easy to use. My contact list was restored in no time.The 13MP camera is really good and, in my opinion, as good as an iPhone. I am exploring the phone's features and it has been a pleasant experience for me.If you are looking to upgrade your phone then PLEASE DON'T LOOK FURTHER!Rajagopalan VBengaluru"
Worth for the money,5,  Worth for the money.. I dont see similar features in other brand for this price range. My parents liked it very much... Wish they added some headphones to this. The color really pop's I was little hesitant while ordering about the color. But it's beautiful üòçüòçüòç
DEFECTIVE PRODUCT RECEIVED,1,"  The bad news was that I received a defective piece (what I feared the most because many customers posted review about defect). The good news was that my refund was processed on the same day as I filed the complaint with picture proof as attached here as well and I received the refund amount within 3 days.Plus, there were these black parallel horizontal lines on the screen, which I just couldn't understand why it was there. The phone looked pretty good (colour and built wise). Maybe would have been a nice one if I hadn't received a defective product."
JUST GO FOR IT.. ü§©,5,"  Amazing phone in such a low price.Great don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick face recognition, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have dual Or tripple cameras because its single camera beats most of the dual and triple camera phones, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick and last thing don't think like its cheap so obviously it will have poor looks and downgraded, no in this phone this isn't the case. Overall I'll give full stars and attaching some samples which have been slightly edited with In built editor.."
Excellent Price!,4,"  I bought this phone in the sale for a ridiculously low price. Firstly if you are someone who uses a lot of apps then this phone is not for you. It is a basic android phone which can be used for photos, WhatsApp and a few others. For the price, one shouldn't expect more. If you load a lot of apps expect the phone to go slow.The build quality was surprisingly excellent and the call quality was also good. Watching videos was also good.Frankly, for this price, I cannot complain about anything.Excellent buy in my opinion."
A good exchange offer,4,"  Pros. 1. This was bought on exchange offer, and I got a good price for my old phone. The exchange was smooth and there were no issues. Was very happy with the transaction.2. I have had it for just two weeks. So I cannot comment on durability, etc. No problem so far. Everything is as described on the Amazon page.3. The phone looks good and I am happy with the purchase.Cons.  Because it was an exchange transaction, the phone was not delivered as fast as for a full cash transaction. I ordered on 25 January and got the phone on 6 February. But I was kept updated about possible delivery dates, etc. So I was not worried.All in all, well worth it."
Good product,4,  The product is good in this price range and as a xiaomi lover you can buy it
Cheap phone with lots of incorrect details,2,  The camera provided in the phone is not  13mp at all.Picture quality is not good and it does not reflect the true colors.its ok that it is a cheap phone but atleast they should mention the correct configuration. If you compare camera picture quality with nokia phones I must say that 2mp camera in nokia made phones have better picture quality that 13mp of this phone. Its OK that this is vewry cheap phone but customer should not think that they will get a 13mp camera. Samsung or nokia make phones with 8mp camera might have better picture quality.rest i can write once i use this phone for a month.
Good and affordable,5,  Very cool phone at this price and camera is average but overall I would recommend choose Redmond over realme
An attractive deal and a reliable phone,4,"  I bought this phone on the amazon prime sale. It was a great deal will a of discounts and I was able to buy it for under ‚Çπ9,000. I've been using this phone for almost a month now and here are my feedbacks.Firstly the good points. Very sleek, good screen size and the menus are user friendly. It has face unlock, pattern and pin unlock as well but no biometric. I can't be asking for more features for this price. 2 sim trays and one SD card tray which is great. I had been using both sim trays form this phone.Now for the bad points. I'm not able to set 2 different ring tones for each sim. So when a call comes in you can only tell by looking at the screen showing on which sim I am getting the call. Next, Screen brightness is not that great. On a bright sunny day, its sometimes not bright enough even if you turn brightness to the highest. Hotspot works fine but you cannot see how many devices are connected. Moreover, you also cannot see which device is connected. Then there are those unwanted, useless Mi apps that comes standard in the phones that send you notifications to upgrade and install even though those apps have not been updated by me.These are the major points. Apart from this, there seems to be no other issues. For a secondary phone this phone is great. Value for money."
Upgraded version of Basic Mobile,2,"  In the name of ""Budget"" phones, quality and features of the mobile is compromised. The camera quality is very poor. Adding to it, the mobile is full of bloatware which reduces the speed of the mobile. Most irritating is ads everywhere - In music, App explorer, Homescreen, in lock mode, wallpaper. You name it and there is an add"
Good quality under budget,4,"  Good product for budget price rangeBut camera quality is average otherwise, value for money  product"
Good,5,"  Happy to buy this good mobile , but little bit specs missing but value for money"
Worst experience,1,  Worst mobile within 10 days we got sound problem. Whatever I am playing no sound at all. After 10 days no return policy.
Dublicate product,1,  One of the Cheapest Chinese product in this category again. It is mentioned as 5000 mah battery in the specification but actually it is not upto the mark. Actually I bought this phone for my father as it has a bigger battery. But it drains automatically within 2 days when there is no usage. But redmi 8A which I am using presently is much better product when compared to this product.I don't know whether XIOMI is prescribing wrong speciation or AMAZON is selling a dublicate product. But my suggestion is don't buy this product even when you have little usage.

Decent product for its price!,4,"  Best choice for low budget.BATTERY:It is upto use. If you use light apps and its normal function battery last upto 5-6 hours approx.#Using heavy apps(games) definately hange the device and heat it up.CAMERA:Looking at its price camera is decent . Quality is not too good, but can capture your precious moments at a decent quality.WEIGHT:Weight is light easy to handle .Looks nice.VIDEO QUALITY:The experience is not that hd  but gives you a nice experience. Sound quality is also good.It doesn't have fingerprint sensor , there is no back cover."
For the price it is ok..,3,  A good phone for the price.Seems little bit lagging. Back camera good but front camera pathetic. Not good for elderly people because bit bulky.Display is ok. Some of the apps like Google nearby sharing and files go app file sharing is not working.For the price range it is ok..Auto display brightness is crappy..
Overall good phone for daily use but go for 3gb variant.,4,"  Phone is good those who want a decent phone for daily use but first of all turn off all annoying ads they provide. No doubt on built quality, it is solid, durable. Battery life is very good. Camera gets the job done for daily use. I have 2gb variant which I won't recommend for others because I can feel slight lag if 4 apps are in the background, Go for Poco C3 3gb variant as it is the same brand of Mi,also it has better processer n u get 500rs discount on HDFC debit card. I trust Mi for long term use, I never had bad experience. Thumbs up if you find this helpful."
Good in use,4,  Smart use

Purchased the 3GB/32GB Nature Green Redmi 9A at Rs. 7499,4,  Purchased the Nature Green colour case on 23 Feb 2021 and was delivered on 25 Feb 2021. I've used it for a good couple of weeks and reviewing this purchase on 09 March 2021.It's value for money. The Camera quality is good and battery life is long as well.Actually I've placed another order for the Sea Blue colour one today.I also purchased mobile case and tempered glass with this purchase. below are the detailsBracevor Hybrid Back Cover Kickstand Case for Xiaomi Mi Redmi 9A and JGD PRODUCTS¬Æ Tempered Glass for Redmi 9A-Edge to Edge Full Screen Coverage.
Pathetic Phone,1,"  Product is below average. This is third Mi phone that I bought and all the three have had network (card) problems. Camera clarity is good but takes 10 sec to launch.. again, poor experience. Battery is good, but compared to other phones in this range, it take double the time to charge... hence the fast charging option too is not at par.Overall A very poor experience with Mi phones. I'll never buy Mi phone in future and WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PHONE."
Don't Buy This!!!,3,"  I ordered this phone day after today and it has been delivered to me. I did not like this phone at all because this phone heats up quickly and the sound of the phone speaker is also very low. Therefore, I would suggest that you spend more than 2000 rupees. And buy other smartphones of Realme.But in this MRP it is good"
Fantastic Smartphone .....,5,  Good Smartphone in low budget lover for normal use.I gifted to my wife and she is very happy with phone and it's colors.I received within 4 days.Redmi needs to price 7000 with fingerprint function.Thanks
Good inexpensive phone,3,"  It comes with 2GB of RAM. The Redmi 9A runs Android 10 and is powered by a 5000mAh non-removable battery. The Redmi 9A supports proprietary fast charging. As far as the cameras are concerned, the Redmi 9A on the rear packs a 13-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture.Redmi 9A is not the best choice when choosing an inexpensive smartphone. It got a lot of flaws. On the positive side of Redmi 9A, there are high-quality assembly and materials of use. Also, the screen size is larger, decent battery life"
Good and worth it.,4,"  Got delivered on time. Best budget level phone. Has good outer body design with attractive colour.Specs are good and user interface is smooth and lag free.Cameras are okay, not great. Yes it has a AI mode for better usage.Gets warm while using but no heating issue. Came with 55% battery charge.Overall a good buy in this price range."
Overall good product,3,  Battery quality superb at this rate .long lasting.camera quality is not good as I thought.average camera.display is perfect. Not useable for gamers.aged people can use.overall good phone.kindly press the helpful button
Good mobile at 7k range,4,"  I bought this mobile to use it for calling purpose ,just needed an extra mobile for me. It comes with 3 gb ram and 32 gb hd., Which is suffice to me. Its a good phone for basic necessities like calling, browsing and apps, not a good camera, no fingerprint reader, battery life is good, charging is fast. It's a value for money if you looking at a mobile with 7k range with big screen size and 3 gb ram."
Don't Purchase this product...,1,  Issue started within 10 days of purchase of this product. My phone doesn't charge inspite keeping in charging for 2 hours.Amazon gave us 07 days replacement but the issue started on 10th day. Spoken to the team denied replacement of the product told us to go redmi service gallery for any issue. Now have to keep all my work aside and have to run behind the gallery people to get my phone repaired..Highly disappointed with the services from Amazon ..Worst Worst Product Don't buy people...

Beaware!!!,5,"  In description, mention that the mobile is manufacturing by Rising Stars Mobile india pvt. Ltd., that is India, But see the picture, there mention Made in China.As per my coversation with Amazon as follows:1. Firstly they say...the batch or the lot which you have received possibly it's a old one.Me: how is this possible, after lunch, i purchase this phone on 2nd sale. How it could be old one.2. Amazon: From now onward the same product we are providing to our customers it's ""manufacturing in India"" this information is mentioned on the box itself.Me: what is this means, from now onward...Means previously manufactured in china or actual manufactured in china, there after comes to india and just replace the sticker.How is possible, a product made in India and print on that item other country name.I think they make people to fool and make money, just writing MADE IN INDIA.I request to you also, those are purchased this item please check the truth.And lastly this is possible on mobile/ any other products, those we cheated by amazon."
GOOD BUDGET PHONE,4,"  Redmi 9A is one of the most affordable smartphone by Redmi. It is available in two variants of 2GB + 32GB model priced at Rs. 6,799, while the 3GB + 32GB variant carries a price tag of Rs. 7,499.I Purchased on 23rd Sep.20.l expect it will be good. It is in great  demand. I think it's a good budget  Phone."
Very bad,1,  I hope these reviw help those who want to buy it is not good pohne at all as it hangups a lot for daily usade event the pohne also does not ha a type c which is downgraded. If you want to take these pohne it is bad opt even the delivery services also sucks and very bad service from amazon even i dont want to give single star also
Front camera is very disappointing during nightlights.,3,"  Overall it is a very budget phone.In 6799 it is offering 6.5 inch screen. Screen is good and HD. I don't expect much from this phone as I have gifted it to my wife,so no need of high end multitasking and speed performance but its front camera is very disappointing during night. It shows very blurry pictures in night. The dot dots are very much visible while taking pictures at night, just like a classic phone cameras of 2005 2010. I have used many MI phones ,the cameras was upto the mark,but this time its very disappointing.I was so disappointed with the camera that I ordered replacement but I cancelled it soon for not taking the headache of setting up the phone again. I think it wasn't the single piece defect. There's a degraded quality front camera in redmi 9A. In daytime there's no issue but it is not meant for pictures in nightlights."
Worst,1,  This is hanging a lot and they don't return it ..... Just replace the product worst phone don't go for it
Too Good to Handle in Daily life,5,  thanks Amazon for so good product at best price in the marketphone is very big size screen and 3 GB RAM is totally smooth function to operatecamera is too good and quality is goodall the functions are working properly and the best thing is that it has very nice grip in the back side
Hanging,1,"  Believe the review its hang much.Even in the calling tab when you touch on the search people it takes time.2gb ram what a joke its not even working like 1gb.My old redmi note 3 (2017) works greater than thisThis is so irritating.If you have budget issue, I will suggest you to buy other brand. if you want to buy only redmi then I will suggest you to don't buy any redmi phone that's falls under 10000."
Not much expected,3,  Camera quality is not much expected. Battery backup and screen size is good
Nice Phone in 2300 because i got it in a exchange of my old realme c2,3,"  Nice Phone in 2300 for me in exchange my realme c2Pros to be considered :-Camera -3.5* , nice picture in 13mp don't compare to 48 or 64 at this price i think it's better than my previous phone the photos look naturalDisplay - 4*  ,6.5 inch 720p big and nice display but could have been little brighterProcessor - 3*. The g25 is decent for daily useag but, They could have provided g35 atleast but in day to day nice performance , normal game running without any problem.Battery - 3.5* , battery life is nice can run whole day with normal and some gaming no problem but one issue they said it was 5000mah battery but if you check in any Phone information app on Google Play they show only 4100mah battery so you can check yourselfCons  to be considered:-Now there is no gyroscope or electronic compass in sensors , no or blaster ,no type c , no fingerprint sensor.In 7k i would not recommend this phone redmi 7a is much better deal or realme c3 , but since i got it in a exchange of only 2300 rupees i think it's bang for buck deal for me, but GST are increased to 18% so if you buy any 10000 phone you will pay 1800 or 2k to tex in government so smartphone prices are increased dramatically , that's why they are no longer value for money phone in smartphone market right now.Amazon service is really incredible for exchange, i try to exchange my phone through flipkart but they denied for no reason they have fraud exchange policy. But i have very nice experience with Amazon service , the delivery boy was good too ,Thanks for fantastic service Amazon.Thanks for your time and reading this long review.I will update later"

Good,5,  Amazing product with this price
Go for it!,5,  The phone is good to give an elder person who does not need a very powerful phone. It's also gotta  large  screen that apt for reading. I say go for it as a budget phone. Gifted it to my mother... She is not the least bit tech savvy. I have not tried any heavy gaming on it so cannot say.The daylight photos are stunning and clear. Have not checked not time pictures.The charger get the phone charged pretty quick.Using it for fifteen days.Go for it!
A downgrade over Redmi 8A. Not worth it.,3,"  When you consider its predecessor the 8A/8A Dual, this one is a major downgrade. A sluggish Helio chipset, Type B charging port, an unnecessarily tall screen, bad camera all combine to deliver a not so VFM product. I am saying this coz I have the 8A Dual as well... Not impressed. With every series, there are too many compromises which is very much unlike Redmi"
Great value for money with low budget,4,  It doesn't comes with fingerprint sensor althought phone has massive battery with decent processors.charging around 2.5 hrs to complete from 0 to 95%. I didn't face any bugs right now. Made of this phone is excellent build quality and big screen added much advantage  it comes with 10w mi charger not supports fast charging.
Value for your money,3,  Value for money....Mediatec processor is bit slower.. dont expect a good cam..Frond cam was good  ...A good phone for older people who did not use much apps...6800 INR
Not so good,3,"  Camera quality is not as per the expectations, with 13 mp you get better camera quality but this phone has bad camera quality pics along with phone volume very less. Average phone i would say for regular use but doesn't justify it's specifications."
Radmi 9A,5,"  Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range."
It sucks,1,"  Within 4 months of buying this phone, the storage was full. I didn't get even half of the 32 gb this phone bragged about. And that's all because of the useless pre-installed apps this phone comes with that no one, NO ONE, needs. I can't get rid of those stupid Xiaomi apps. This sucks. Never buying from Xiaomi again."
Good for below average users.,3,  The performance is not as good as specified in the discription. Camera parameters are good but the picture is not as good as it should be with these specifications. Overall it is good for below average users. But don't think of playing games on it as it hangs even on playing simple games like subway surfers. Battery is good and lasts about a day.
JUST A SIMPLE PRODUCT. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH,4,  To be frank it is a good product for the priceYou can't expect too much from it‚Ä¢The camera is ok type but not much features in editing the photos‚Ä¢There too many in built apps but they can be removed if not required‚Ä¢The screen is not bright at all its really dull to see‚Ä¢good delivery by amazon‚Ä¢Only good thing is that you get 3gb with 32 GB storage and a really big screen‚Ä¢It is good for people who don't expect much from their mobiles and use phones for a basic necessity‚Ä¢If you are looking for more features then I do not recommend this you have other options in this price‚Ä¢You also need to buy a cover and screen protector‚Ä¢The box only has the phone with charger and the manual with invoice of bill
Better to not to purchase MI products,1,  I am writing this review after 6 months....After 6 months phone was automatically restart & some time it will go to off mode it may takes 1 or 2 day's to  come back to on mode.... Service center guys saying bord issue but this boar was not available now....
Worth!,4,"  In this price, this is perfect smartphone for a beginner or senior citizens.**Camera quality is not good as expected. Basic front camera. Rear camera is ok.**No fingerprint scanner, but thank god Face unlock is there.****Good thing is display size and quality.üëç"
Redmi 9A 3GB RAM RS. 7499 AMAZON'S DELIVERY IS SUPERB üëç,2,"  Batteryüîãis ok, camera is worstüëé  you will receive only 20Gb approx to use rest Will be filled with Preinstalled mi apps,Amazon delivery is very fast ‚ö° but mobile quality is not upto the markGiving two ‚≠ê‚≠ê only for Amazon"
Overall good... üòç,5,"  I personally really like this smart phone at this price...  The camera quality is good... As we know the  more camera quality the more price... It is even light weight....By the way I really like it..  I recommend everyone who is finding the smartphone at that price,  he or she should bye.....But about one thing in this phone  I am disappointed,  it is the fingerprint scanner..Over all perfect even I have no words to say.. üòÄüòÖüòç..Value of money....Please click on helpful,  if you found it helpful..  Amazon service well an good .."
Great Phone at this Budget and Ultra Fast Delivery.,5,"  I really Love Redmi Phones. My First Phone was Redmi 8A. I bought this phone as a Gift for my Dad.Great offers by Amazon for this Phone. You cant Buy a Super Smartphone Like this at a Price Range of 7500 Rs - 3GB  RAM Variant anywhere in the Online World or at Retail Stores. I love the Fact that Redmi 9A is Far Lighter than Redmi 8a. I ordered the Phone on 2nd November and i Got it on 3rd November. It was not even a Complete day, as there was 2 hrs left for a day to complete. Fastest Delivery by Amazon even for a Standard Delivery Order. I would love to continue my Shopping with Amazon.You can Go for this Phone Blindly.Such a Feasible phone. Love it."
Good deal for the price offered .,4,"  Overall the mobile phone is ok for the price , should have provided fingerprint scanner which is very common now , battery life is good , camera üì∏ is somewhat ok , look is good , very good for normal user , no hesitation in recommending this product ."
its good,4,"  Purchased for my dad, used past 10 days and seems good so far. Look and feel, build, battery life is good. Features are smooth. not played any games and also not done any multi processing so not sure about performance."
Good phone,2,"  good phone for money 7500, 32gb memory, 3gb ram enough is good for normal use, hd display awesome, Played game temple run, Visualation is outstanding, quick response in touch, sound quality average. Camera portrait mode is super. Selfie camera very average.Missing futures infrared remote control, finger print sensor, lighting sensor.overall okay for the budget"
Worth for money,4,"  Writing this review after using this phone for some weeksThis phone is absolute worth for moneyBut iam not a giving a five star rating because iam ana ios lover and generally iam using ios phonesI brought this for my grandfather and by his opinion it's perfectBt i feel a problem that 3gb ram feature is only in it's boxSo if you are a game lover iam not suggesting this for you , but it's perfect for middle agedThe fingerprint sensor is fastBattery life is also goodAmd the camera quality is averge"
"Waste of Money, Worst Processor (MediaTek)",1,"  Battery is good , but mediatek processor is worst , too much hanging and slow processFor Adapter Data Cable is very short arround 1.2 feet , You need Buy One apart from this, it's a extra expense to buy a data cable.Only good thing is no heat producing on charging as well as normal usage , Battery is Superb, arround 1 full day if you are using continuousBetter go Redmi 8A DualSingle star for Redmi 9A, I wasted my money, there is no exchange options for this phone"
Review after 2 day use.,5,"  Camera quality: good image attached from both facing rear and front.Battery life : after full charge work 2 day with all the activities you can doFinger print : doesn't have finger printGlass and display : very crystal clear display but glass is not Corning gorilla.AI Face Lock: working good, some time it's not recognize."
Redmi 9a 3/32 in  not  availableFingerprint  sensor. Battery and camera Qlity Normal.,4,  Fingerprint sensor not available.battery and camera qlity  Normal .I am not proper use after used full review. Why full review not permitted .
Recommended,5,"  A very good item at this price range, bought two pieces for my kids, they loved it, they used it for playing games( Pubg,) they say it run smooth. Big battery..last whole day. Camera, sound and all other features are up to the mark."
Charger kit missing,1,  Need charger kit missing . Complained already raised . Not am issue my mobile .Am already paid temper glass and back cover . This explanation alt submit to customer care . Also my son study online class . Some education app . Already downloaded . So not possible submit to u my mobile . Need only charger kit. By krishnamoorthy .Advice to delivery person .
Nice Buy for parents,5,  I bought 2 GB Ram mobile for my parents. Its working well and surprisingly it looks slim and weight also less compare to other 5000mps battery mobiles. Big display is the game changer here. User friendly OS.For elders they dont need finger scanner . Finally satisficed with the all round impression under the price of 6200/-Average camera can not expect more at this price range at this moment.
Overall a good product in budget.,4,  I liked its processing speed which is very good. The ram is genuinely faster. Camera quality is average. Battery backup in this range is also good. The only problem with this model is that it does lack a good internet speed. I mean whatever sim card you are using this device will not give that much internet speed than what you expect. Sometimes the experience is horrible. The internet speed is very slow in this device whether you use any 4g sim. But what do you expect in this budget. It is a budgeted phone with some limitations.
Budget Friendly,3,"  Purchased this for my Mom. I don't say that this is an awesome mobile but I can tell you that at this price range it's okay to gift this to people for normal usage. Although the camera quality wasn't good at all, I was happy with the ram and storage provided at this price range.Camera Quality: 1/5Processor: 3/5Battery Life: 5/5Worth the money: 4/5"
Not at all happy with the product üòï,1,  I have ordered this Redmi 9A mobile phone as it is reasonable and compatible with my daily use as per the reviews which i got but unfortunately after owning it i have had very bad experience with the battery as it always heats up to the extreme and seems like it can explode any moment..and that too it was for the first time i have connected the charger and was shocked when it got heated up.I request the product approval team to please take a look into this issue with the product.I hope won‚Äôt be disappointed next time.Thank you!
How phone working,4,  Nice phone
- Phone hangs very frequently - Battery life is not reliable if you travel a lot.,3,  Like:- Features which exist in this price range of 6.5K -7K. Makes the phone affordable to many looking out for budget phone with an aim to use for 3 yrs.Dislike: Honest feedback from an educated & wise user.- Phone hangs very frequently (Even when space is enough nd the phone is new like 1 month)- Battery life expires in 24hrs. if you internet is on & talk continuously (I do due to my work). in 12hrs. if you watch too many online videos or listens music.
Value for money,5,  The product is awesome. Looking drop dead eye‚ù§
Nice product within the given price range!,5,"  Redmi 9A (32 GB) is a good mobile phone for those with limited budget. It has got all the nice features and functions. The screen is big, good fingerprint reader, amazing battery life, and a nice camera quality.The phone functions smoothly overall."
Cheap and best,4,"  It is worthable for this price, we can't play pubg and equal to pubg games. For online class this one much enough for the school and college students, it doesn't come with headphone,Camera quality rear is good and the front is OK for online class not for over exposure,It doesn't have finger print, screen size is bigger.I can suggest the people who is trying to buy this product.Seller send me the courier with safe and goodWe can buy it.Enjoy all!"
Best budget phone.,5,  I bought it for 5199 Rs with exchange (samsung J7) . I'm not much into camera or gaming. I bought it for daily use. Best battery life and good camera. Big screen makes watching movie great. Totally good buy for 5199 Rs.
Go for it if you have a tight budget!,4,"  1) Battery life is great!!üëåNo heating problem is found...2) Back camera is good in this price...3) While video recording with front camera i have found little bit hazy, but while taking selfie it is clear, could not understand why this is happening...4) Time taken for full charging from 20% battery life :- 2 hrs with its 10w charger5) Voice recording is very good & clear! Perfect for singers...6) A fingerprint sensor should be provided!‚òπÔ∏è7) Display is also Nice...8) Otherwise satisfied in this price..."
Decent. But worse camera,3,  Overall mob is good. They say it has 32gb storage available but when u get the mobile due to all internal apps u get only 20gb left. Never felt lag Or hang due to multie use of apps. Os quite ok. But worst thing is camera. It's almost same quality as some keypad mobile. And they have done a frod saying it's 13 mp but only 10 mp!!!!!!!!!! with badquality. And photos do not have shot on redmi. Exept camera overall decent mobile
Nice Phone at this price.,5,"  Redmi 9A is a good phone for normal use. The battery life is really encouraging. Battery lasts for almost two days even if Social medias are used. Sound quality is good, Camera is good at its level.Overall a value for money phone."
"Don't Buy,, Useless Camera,, Awesome UI",2,"  Don't Buy,, below avg Camera, for 13 MP, Its not even 2MP camera, Camera has very Low (live FP), MI WAS GOOD BUT NOW MI IS MAKING MONEY, My old MI 6 prime is better than this it has which cost 6000INR,, GO for RealMe C2,  same 13 MP camera for 7000 INR only, is Awesome... Dont Buy MI EVER they are making money now"
Good,3,  No finger print. Just below average phone. It's good for an average use. But its Worth of 7500. Good for online class. I think no other company gives 3gb ram and 32 gb memory with 5000 mah battery and fine camera quality. With 7500 rs
Wow redmi 3rd quality,1,"  This phone is looking good but working bad,very lowest quality phone.If I want search number with any alphabet in contact takes to much time ,all time slow working.So dont buy this phone .Other wise you will  realise after purchae me like because return window has close ,so I have no option.Waste my money."
Not good.,3,"  Direction sensor(magnetometer sensor)not in this phone.You can't get directionality when using maps(you will be always facing one direction.)Apart from this everything is fine for this budget.Not better than Redmi8A dual.I am satisfied with this phone because this is my secondary phone.But for thu guys who are having this as their first,you have better options if using a vouple of hundreds more."
4Star,4,  Redmi9A is really a best phone under this price but when we talk about its camera its third class and you can't buy this phone for photography purpose. Overall phone is good for normal working.
Excellent üëå,5,  My review after using it for 12 daysBest smartphone in this budgetSmartphone is very fast and smooth workingOnly defect is that the camera quality is average but at this price it's perfect
ordered on diwali sale,5,  when ordering your m-phone online you can't review cam. battery health etc.You might be wasting time.That's already available in bulk on YT.You can get detailed review of all there. Talking about order and exp. i've been ordering now since quite a while approx. mpre than 4-5years now.Delivery agent was quite polite this time.packing was excellent.product was up to the mark.every thing was good.Go for it![ amazon ]
Lovely,5,  Good product
Defective display panel,2,"  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†The dispaly went flickering from the moment I unpacked the phone and booted it. Disappointed and ordered a replacement. Issue didn't resolve even in multiple reeboots or taking MIUI update after first boot."
Not satisfied,2,  I ordered this phone 1 month ago in the flash sale ...that time I got that phone ..& it was written Made in India...But yesterday I received my 2nd phone.it is written Made in China...why is this? I am really confused...& My space button is not working at the time of contact saving.
Fabulous 1,5,"  Again 1 more redmi 9 series with our family. This time for our mother-in-law. We hope in first sights itself looks like made for her, simple and user friendly phone with all good feature's,,, great to go head,,,"

A great buy for Under 7k.,3,"  ""Battery life"" is great to be honest. i like the display tall, Bright. ""camera quality"" is not match any expectations. Expectations was quite average though for this price point. bloatware always been a hurdle for Mi phones.If You get it under 7K 3gigs ram go for kill.""Game performance"" was good as per the price G25 surprisingly Good processor. Overall a value for money. Ditching Fingerprint not a great option though."
Overall good performance,5,"  The one thing which every Xiaomi mobile is having is its abnormal weight compared to other mobile brand phones of similar features. The camera does not reach up to the expectation but the overall performance of the mobile phone is all ok. It has no fingerprint sensor, thus allows only face and other unlocking systems. An average person can definitely go for it if they dislike Vivo."
Even a one-star rating is more to it.,1,"  Just after 47 days of purchasing it, I got a problem with the phone. It started to reboot in a loop. Then I took it to the servicing center. The problem was resolved. I wish I could end this happily ever after. But, my happiness didn't last long. Hell! it didn't even last for 2 hours. The very next day I went to the servicing center again, the story repeats. SO I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE, as it's a waste of your time, energy, and money."
Phone,5,  The best phone üìûThis phone was good quality and camera and strogeBest priseNice phone üìû
Overpriced. Go for redmi 9i on Flipkart.,2,  Good battery life but expensive for this price tag as you can get redmi 9i at same price on Flipkart. Both mobiles are same but 9i has 4gb ram & 64gb memory.Go for Redmi 9i on flipkart.3gb ram lags a bit.
Exceptionally cool,5,"  Splendid trendy smart phone, great finish, touch sensors, display in par with more upmarket products.In a budget friendly way, suits basic function, üì∑ is good.Worth the price quoted.Thank you."
Great Mobile with all basic features perfectly matched,5,"  Excellent mobile, bought it for my mother great battery life and nice Camera for the price, My Mother makes phone calls watches YouTube and WhatsApp and she gets nearly 3 days of battery life, she is very happy, small problem is the earpiece sound is a bit low."
Nice phone,5,  Best mobile phone
Device is a pathetic,1,"  The phone quality is best but the performance isn't.The phone gets usually hang within 2 appa running in the background. You can't expect more From this device. I'm using this phone for only Calling purpose for my company sim. I have OP 7 pro for my uses, but this phone is really needs a strong software database, good camera quality, ram performance for smooth use."
Sought of Good Mobile at this price,4,"  The display of the mobile is good enough and battery life is awesome. Camera is you can say OK sought but what to expect in such a low price. A little bit hanging issue due to 2GB RAM , else otherwise everything is good. I got it for Rs.6120 (10% SBI credit Card discount) . You can go for it."

It's made in china,1,"  Don't buy this phone , it's made in China"
1 month with you another at service centre,1,"  Worst phone ever bought. After using for nearly 20 days it stopped taking charge. Service center found mother board fault & change it, after that in play store log in itself it turned off again permanently. 2nd service center visit updated the software & it started working. Now if I use it for 2-3 minutes continuously it restarts. Forget about gaming or any smartphone activity."
Not taking update,1,"  Not taking update for Google Chrome and webview system. I called up Amazon customer care, but they did not respond and behavior of customer executive was very wrost"
Average phone- serves its cost,3,"  Average phone, do not expect too much in case of performance. For first time touch pad buyers, if u have already used better configuration u won‚Äôt like it at all. This phone is to give a budgeted gift. Teenagers better put some more money and buy better one.."
Good product,4,  Quality is good in the price range below Rs 7000  battery does not last long and camera captured quality will be ok if you are looking for high quality camera or high battery back up you need to buy higher version model in higher price segment
A unbeatable budget kingü•∞,5,  Got the product today. I am so much happy with the build quality and look of the phone .No other phone have this asthetic look in this price segment.Camera quality also so good. Main attraction about this phone is its display. It's a big gorgeous HD panel in its segment.Considering all things redmi did a great jobWith 9AGO blindly with this product of your budget is 6999
Hangs a lot with a black screen and stops working,1,  Bought two phines and It's been 7 days only and both the phone starts hanging along with a black screen and then needs a restart.‡•§‡•§Worst part is I am not able to avail servicing facility by amazonAlso brand service is ignoring my complaints

Average android phone,2,"  Heat problem and less battery backup, hope this will be fixed in android update."
good as a gift,4,  this product is for the people who are in search of average smartphone in an average price range. camera is a little average and it feels a little heavy probably due to its 5000Mah battery and large body but performance is good and there is no heat problem over heavy uses even. This is not for gaming purpose but i played lite games and performance was good. Overall good for general purpose.
Just Average product,3,  Its not an i was expecting. The disappointed me this time. As i come camera of redmi and other with same megepixel i found other much better than it. Battery is good you can use it full day and charger is also fast . But for very normal usage you can bought this product but if you are heavy user dont think about it. It lags sometime.
Excellent Phone at affordable price.,5,  The phone is excellent. Super fast charging. Camera is very decent. Screen is bigger than earlier versions of Redmi phone. Highly recommended.Go for it.üëçüëç
nice,5,  This product from redmi is fine under this price but the display is really bad i think so if you are willing to add some more money üí≤ then go for other product
"Terrible Face Unlock, No Fingerprint sensor",1,  1- Display quality sucks. 720p video seems like 480p.2- Cameras are terrific.3- Too much lags.4- Unstoppable Miui ads.5- Face Unlock usually takes 5-10 seconds and most of the time it doesn't work.6- No Fingerprint sensor.7- Battery is draining more quickly and fast charging is also gone after 5 months.Bottom line- Don't buy this Covid phone.
"Wrong Product, fake promises",1,"  Brought a phone only when it was written  it would be manufactured in India, but when it was delivered we got a made in China product ...... Absolutely fake promise by Amazon ...... When I initiated a replacement request there's no one to acknowledge..... Pathetic service.........!!!!!!!"
Network catching problem,4,  Phone is good. But mobile network catching problem very slowly.you tube not open in my mobile.sir I am very sad.please write down my information
Best phone of rs 6500,5,  I think it is the best phone of rs 6500 no othe company can give us so better product as redmi 9a it is very good phone for lite use but if u are a heavy user then u have to excess your range at 10000Sorry not for pubg or freefire users  but helio p25 is a good prossessor........... It also may not for a camera loveThanks for reading .............................. üôè
Budget smartphone,5,"  One o the budget smartphone in the market1. Long battery life2. Fingerprint reader is nice and smooth3. Good for old age peole like parents and grand parents because it is economic and also a smartphone as well .4. According to price it is enough to hold all the features like others smartphone have like battery, camera and others .In my opinion go for it ."
Made in china,1,"  Made in china, build quality bad, speaker also not good...pls go with redmi 9 or redmi 9 prime made in india version"
Good product for the price but could be better if included a back cover & screen guard,4,  Overall good product nominal peformance for daily tasks but not at all suggested for multitasking or gaming or photography coz AF its a budget phone so just fits right with the regular flow. No back cover & screen guard & takes lot of time to charge

Worst ever I seen.,1,"  Camera quality is not good,touch screen behaves unintended input when you make call by close by ear.Flash Light seems low power.Face locking system is not much better as expectation.No Magnetic Sensor, so you can't use compass feature or app.Some of bluetooth headset v5 doesn't works.*** I will suggest better to go for another ****"
Ok phone but as per price & performance its a little high priced,3,  Frequent call drops happen. Good screen etc & camera quality but battery is not that good especially if you have you are connected to data or wifi most times. Most annoying is the call drops & you have to redial & connect.Overall an OK phone which could have been priced lower with the quality it possesses
Don't purchase this.Go for any other phone .,1,"  The processor is extremely slow , even can't process Chrome browser efficiently .Absolute waste of money ,choppy apps.Camera is a disaster with lot of noise and poor light sensing technologyHigh contrast is visible in photos.Poor quality at low light .Don't purchase thisIf you r still here ,that proves u r dumb to think about purchasing this."
Worth buyable under this price.,4,"  Ordered nature green coloured mobile, Amazon delivered in 2 days. Colour is slightly different (dark) than what is visible on site. Battery performance is superb and processor performance is upto the mark. Indoor pics are not good with its camera."
Good budget phone for students studying online @home,5,  Bought this for someone else whose kids needed a phone with good Wi-Fi connectivity for online studies.Working Gr8 for him!Battery life is quite good..
Phone started rebooting not good,2,"  Phone started rebooting n files got corrupted.In 9 days only, I have to take it to service center.Software needs proper handle of corruption"
Crashed and useless after 2 months,1,"  Worst mobile ever, within 2 months it got cashed. Everyone time i open the mobile it displays MiUi and got shut down. There is no option over Amazon to return/replace after 10 days now, where to complain to who should we reach out there is no clue at all."
"Third Class, too slow, waste of money phone",1,"  I specially recommended you to don't buy this phone. If you're planning to buy for your old parents or uneducated people meaning they will use only RED & GREEN buttons than you can buy otherwise please avoid buying.Too slow and hanging phone, talking about other features meaning insulted them.PURCHASING A FEATURE PHONE WILL BE GOOD INSTEAD OF IT."

Cameras,3,  Camera quality is not up to the mark in deem light. During day time in presence of sunlight pictures are wonderful.But in side room quality is very poor.Battery life is satisfactory.Speed of using apps are satisfactory.Screen size is large.
Buy Redmi 9i if u have more budget,5,"  Best smartphone @this price..... overall good and buy from this seller because he is just amazing simply I ordered on 6/Oct and I got it delivered by 8/Oct in morning 10:00 am it's really unbelievable in such pandemic situation right now.... thanks Amazon for this service,no negative marks"
Made in China,2,  The product is made in China and how mi is selling in India after the ban of Chinese phones in India.
worst mobile,1,"  Worst mobile ever, primary function of mobile is calling yet this mobile showing unique problem that on calling fellow person doesnt hear voice at all. as well service centre not able to solve problem. worst camera quality ever."
Good entry level device,4,"  I was looking for an entry level budget phone with latest features, this device serves the purpose, natural green color is awesome.  Beware, the device comes with 'Made in China' label."
Not buy 2gb ram,3,  The built quality is good not great if you are buying this please by the 3gb variant which gives more value of you by GB variant it will lag under 2 months
"Entry level, Value for money,",4,"  Battery life is good after use of intense calls, internet and video lasting for 3 days. Camera quality is good for entry level user. Value for money. So far not use for gaming."
Value for old exchange mobile,5,  Good! as purchased this mobile in exchange offer which is the best in deal. Good battery life. Good picture quality. Overall my experience is 10 out of 10. Thanks amazon for this wonderful exchange offer.
After using one month 9A,4,"  It is fully budget phone for mostly aged people to user smart phone, with low cost and high performance.If you want to use for long term and less use of apps and gaming then go for this 9A which is having good battery backup big screen with 3 GB ram etc."
Below average phone,2,"  It is very slow, lags a lot and hangs occasionally. It gets heated up if you use internet for long. No Gorilla glass, no fingerprint sensor, battery backup is good and camera is ok. Big screen with average display and Sound is a bit low. Dual apps and split screen function is missing. Its a low budget phone from Redmi. Go for better options"
Phone is slow,1,"  I found the phone a bit slow and lags in certain areas. Previously, I was using redmi 7a, 2Gb so I thought this phone might a good upgrade. But disappointed."
"Phone for people who uses Youtube, Whatsapp and for calls.",4,"  The product is decent in the price range. If you use the phone moderately only for calls, youtube or WhatsApp, then this is the best phone. I bought it for my mother and she felt happy, The screen is big and the battery is also good only if you use it moderately. Bought it for 6200 rupees."
Mobail so good and camera quality,5,"  Mobail so good and camera quality osm and battrary is so good, fingerprint one touch finger"
Not a good option,1,  1- Mobile is very slow. Skype app buttons response in 15 seconds.2- Touch of mobile is really bad.3- camera is also very poor.4- this mobiles comes with customised os. Which includes lot of third party apps which makes this mobile slow.5- finger or biomateic is not available.
Nice screen,5,  Battery life is good. I've been using it for 2 months now and it's great. It handles all social media apps very well and the calling audio quality is very good.
Terrible phone. Not even value for money.,1,  There is no magnetometer or gyroscope. Compasses wont work and even google map wont show which direction i am facing accurately. I bought it and regretted my purchase within the hour. No value at all for me. There is a lot of false advertising in other review websites which prompted me to get this.
Worth buy,5,  If you want to purchase a mobile under 6.8k it will be a better one. Giant display at 6.8k. Massive battery backup. Bought the mobile for Rs.6120 in great indian festival.
Slow as snail,2,  The phone is super slow. If one is navigating from one app to another it takes 5-6 second to open.If you open chrome it takes 10 second to open.Camera quality is not good (though the expectations from camera was not much).
9a mobile is good another,5,  Premium look..
Think twice.,3,"  Display and camera quality are too poor, else phone is ok, so it's better to spend few more buck for a better experience. However phone is good for new users."
Good From Xiaomi!,5,  Got this for 6400‚Çπ during the sale and feels like it satisfies the price paid for the device! Good product from Xiaomi! Go for it
POOR QUALITY MOBILE,3,"  I have been using the redmi 9A mobile for 7 months. Atfirst I think it will be good mobile, but now it seemed not good. Its scrolling is not smooth, sometimes it hangs, it shows full network signal but doesn't give net speed and even youtube doesn't continue smoothly. I don't play any online games like freefire or others. Camera isn't good. Only one thing is its battery is good."
WiFi hotspot doesn't connect to Laptop,3,"  Handset is fine for daily usage, video calling, zoom meeting etc. But the biggest drawback is its WiFi hotspot doesn't get connected to Laptop. I had tried several troubleshooting but nothing has worked. Really disappointed with this as I need to work on my laptop with internet on."
Not a Good Handset in,2,"  Not a good handset, its very slow and camera quality is not good. It had purchased it for my dad. Sold it back on olx after 1 month. The only best thing is battery. Charges quickly and runs long"
Super,5,  Excellent battery back upFingerprint reader goodCamera quality also good in this range especially capturing in low light.Overall good deal.
I claim replacement of device / smart phone as  this product is under warranty period .,1,"  Our product purchased from Amazon is under warranty , manufacturing defect as wel as battery performance.But sorry to report that while charging the battery of this smart phone ,this device has been fully destroyed due to blast of the battery of smart phone .So plz replace this product with a new one as per the warranty."
Not worth for money,1,"  Camera quality is poor, battery life is better. Don't get fooled by the average ratings. Never go for this. Go for some other phones at this rate please read reviews in another site before buying this phone.  Posting the review for third time. Hope this will get posted this time."
Too slow....not worth it...,1,"  Camera quality is not so good, initially I thought phone is nice. However, after using this, m so frustrated and it's too slow. It's a waste of money. Don't buy this. Once again telling, it's very very slow..... please don't refer my previous comment"
Good for Average user's,4,  In the budget it's worth to buy.Worth to spent every penny.Good design and built.üîã Battery backup is fine
Everything is good except camera quality,4,"  I bought this mobile for my mom, she likes it. Everything is good in this mobile like display, sound, battery life, etc except the camera quality.

Super smartphone for older people (brilliant beginners phone)......,4,"  Decent phone for this price range. But I am not recommend this phone to any youngster who is approaching this phone with an intention to play games. If battery, decent camera (with gcam) are your  main concern then go for it. You can also enjoy other features which normal smartphone offers nowadays."
Worth the price,4,  The handset is good1. Great battery life.2. Display has good pixels.3. Screen is big.4. Ram speed is very fast.5. Camera quality is so so.6. Network hold a lot
Not upto the mark,2,"  It takes nearly 3 hrs to charge fully. And battery draining quickly, though they mention duration hrs as 2 days. Camera quality is ok not that much. And while charging mobile is heat up as I kept in fire.specifications seems to be awesome but disappointed with its working condition. We cannot spend 7k often with these issues."
Best Budget Smartphone at 7499üòç,4,"  If You Want to Buy a budget smart phone then really blindly go for this...With A Good Potrait Camera quality, good processor,3gb ram n of course a large battery backup almost 2 days battery life if you are a normal user. It doesn't have fm radio n gorilla glass protection overall it is a budget smart phone at 7500.Go for this"
Good phone,5,  I tried for 3 GB RAM phone but unfortunately got only the 2 GB one. Memory is the only one constrain noticed.
Long term review,3,  Happy with EMI option as it made the purchase affordable.Thanks Amazon.Product is good value.Would have liked a hard case to be bundled.The Micro USB charging port is cumbersome(User is a Senior Citizen)Would have preferred a non Chinese brand.

Best mobile phone in that price range,4,  Great phone at that price point. Other leading brands do not offer these specs in that price range. Well built and really lightweight phone. Love the color though. Long battery life. Great for kids to attend online classes.
"Value for money,",5,"  Overall good product at this price point, Xiomi claiming made in India product, but we received made in China, I had never thought that I will get made in China product. It's very disappointing for me, Amazon delivering most of product  made in China."

Very bad product,1,  Product is very bad. Mobile is heating up very much and screen colour changes after using it for ten days. Some heat waves comes out from the mobile. First time I received such a bad product from Amazon.
Nice phone.,5,"  The phone has a good battery backup (normal use) and nice design.The camera is okay. One problem that I noticed is that: the system apps use internet even the data is disabled. So, I have disabled the mobile data for all apps to avoid losing balance(since no data pack is active in that SIM)."
Decent Phone for a Decent Price,4,  There will always be Pros and Cons even if you buy a lac phone but for this price it justifies the quality and features fairly
"Long battery life, great functionality and fast",4,"  Good, easy to use, functional phone with good speed and apps. I need to charge only twice a week which is awesome. The camera quality is just average or a bit under but that is not why I bought this phone. Other than the picture/video qlty, everything else is awesome. Great value for money."
Good colour and designed,5,  It's battery life and memory are remarkable. It's a great experience to use a redmi phone in this price. It's really a great product
Worth the price!,4,"  Thank you Amazon for delivering the product superfast. The Redmi 9A mobile is worth the price. Not much expectations from the range yet it functions optimum. Good battery, smooth operation, easy AI response for camera and good processing speed."

Best Phone in 7K price range!,5,"  If you ask for one word to describe Redmi 9A it is 'smooth'. It functions effortlessly with 3GB RAM, and every feature sails without nay trouble. Camera is the only con, but how much can one expect in this price range. Well done, Redmi."
Nice phone in this budget,4,  Battery is very very good and other features is also very good in this price. Only negative thing in this phone is weight
Value for money,2,  Value for money but it goes to hanging mode many times.  Had to update the Android.  After that it started working well but it keeps happening. That is irritating.
Camera is cheap n worst but average  phone is good,3,"  With camera not happy, another brand in this range gives good AVG camera ,but all avg it is working well ,writing this after using this phone for 3 months"
Value for money,4,  Due to 2GB ram and pre installed redmi apps the phone is bit laggy but as per price and brand its good. Go for nature green colour its awesome!
Probably the best we can get in this price range,5,"  Got it for my mom, she uses it for over 8h at a stretch, and still has quite a battery life. Redmi has been improving monstrously. The camera quality is so so, but we don't aim for professional photography with it so doesn't bother, performance wise it's the best in this price range"
overall good experience,3,  what do you expect in this price range?. mi has bundled pretty much everything in it. plus blue is also my favourite color so if you are planning to buy it just go for it. good phone at this price range.
Go For It. üôÉ,4,  Truth about this PhonePros:1. Amazing Battery life.2. Decent Camera.3. Android 10.4. Big Screen.5. Sexy look.6. Low price.7. Dedicated Micro Sim Slot.cons:Nothing as the price rage is low. You can not get everything in this price.

BUDGET PHONE,4,"  Product seems genuine. Battery backup as of 4 days seems excellent.Hassle free performance, except for lagging and heating issue at times. Perfect fit for this budget , especially if you are planning to get it for someone who has never used a smartphone, as it's very much user friendly."
Price should be less,3,  Ok product overall. Camera is not upto the mark. Good display. Average sound quality. Body color is slightly different from shown in the ad. I think price should be below 7k

Low budget best mobile but 1 problem,4,  Ossam mobile features in low budgets. All good but YouTube showing 720p maximum and other mobile 360p quality better than 720p qyality on this mobile. But low price main sub kuch expect nehi kar sakte he. Others all good.
Not expected this,1,  I ordered this phone for first time. But 2 gb ram is not sufficient for lagre apps but it can be used for low size apps. Not many apps can be used at a time. Camera is decent.I hate adds which comes whenever we install apps.
Best phone for this price segment,5,  This is the only phone for this price segment and a best suggestion my me. The camera quality is decent and not bad at night any how its worth for the money paid. As provoed big display and dot notch are great for this price and I appreciate it. The power back up with 5000mah is good.
Budget friendly phone under 7.5K bracket,5,"  For a Mid tier phone, it packs every feature that you can except for a phone. The phone does not have a fingerprint sensor given the price it is acceptable. Have a good battery life.So far so good."

Pathetic service,1,"  Amazon promised to replace it as it had error which their technician approved too, but no-one really cared to replace it even after a month and several requests. I am going to think thrice before ordering expensive stuff from here."
"Issue with the charger, rest everything is awesome.",4,  The phone is very nice in condition but it seems like the charger that I received is not of this phone as it is disconnecting again and again and that is why I'm unable to charge my phone.

This phone is goodüëçunder this price 7.5k....,4,  Nice color and style as of now working fine no hang or sound loud but charger is slow.Network connectivity is also strong .......and camera quality is not good but it's ok at this affordable price....Go for it if you have budget of under 8k.

It doesn't get better than this at this price!,4,"  Pretty decent phone for the price.. Being Redmi, it'll probably become slow in a year.. Bought this for a colleague.. Being a light user, it is perfect for him to use whatsapp, facebook and some web browsing.."
